Toward v2.0:
-------------------------
I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do; but I feel like the deck would do better without the high casting cost creatures.
I'm going to also replace Gideon by Elspeth and see how it goes.
I'm still considering Mirran Crusader but feel like: Delver of Secret is a better choice for now due to his 1 CMC.


Note regarding v1.0:
-------------------------

Deck was fun to play, did a lot of mistakes... 
However something felt wrong. 
I should either go Full control or full mid range aggro.

Think twice is terrific! Love it!
Geist is fantastic! :) Equipped with a sword can be better :)
Snapcaster wasn't very useful... 
Gideon didn't help much.
Feels like needs more flying defense.
