What did work: 
  - when Quest for Ula's Temple was out; it worked great!
  - Everflowing Chalice is definitively a good mana acceleration
  - Bloodchief Ascension worked great too!
  - Bringing all creatures in all graveyard out with Liliana's ultimatum was awesome!

What did not work: 
  - The deck is too slow
  - Unfocused.
  - Quest for teh gravelord was useleff
  - Same goes for: Semblance Anvil and Soulstair Expedition

=> Change of deck: 
  - Focus more on the milling/discard to build up Bloodchief ability
  - More creature killing.
  
  Question: what about Ula's quest? (kinda fun)
