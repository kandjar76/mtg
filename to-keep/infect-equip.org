W land: 2+3+3 -> 8
B land: 4+2+6 -> 12
U land: 4+2+2 -> 8

Deck v3.0:
- How about a infect/control deck.
- Idea: few infect creatures: only the Knight and maybe the Norn.
- Going back to UBW

Deck v2.1:
- Modification:
  . Dropping Gideon.
  . Needs draw/proliferate?
  . Needs way to take care of creatures...
  . Adding Garruk; for: another way to get mana acceleration?
- Cancelled for now.

Deck v2.0: 
- First downside; no real Man land (3/4 w/ reach...)
- Fetch lands: Marsh Flats. Verdant Catacombs  -- Great for landfall.
  -> Land fall infect???
- Deck designed -- needs some play test!
- After playtesting the deck:
  . The current version seems to be relying way too much on the lotus cobra.
  . The deck needs way to take care of creatures.

Deck v1.0:
- After play-testing the deck; it didn't work at all.
The lack of mana didn't help at all.
The main issue; the deck is too slow while he want to be fast.
- Going toward: WGB instead of WUB.
Probably bringing the lotus cobra in!
