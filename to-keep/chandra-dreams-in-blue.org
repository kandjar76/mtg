Comments:

Note: the deck didn't worked at all!
Sword don't work here at all..
Maybe because they are not enough creatures and too many creatures removal in my opponents deck.
Or: not enough counters... 

The deck did nothing even against weak vampire decks.
And got completely destroyed against Tempered Steel deck.

One of the main issue is the mana colors. 
Only 4 fetch lands to get the colors isn't enough when six 3 CMC spells requires 2 hard colors (4 phoenix and 2 jaces)

I don't think the sphinx belongs in this deck, the same goes for Jace Memory Adept.
