v1.2:
-----

4 Phanstasmal image is a bit too much.
Also: I want to be able to have a blue creature out before playing the grand architect.
And being able to recast spell from the graveyard is a really good option too.

Another point: tragic slip is nice; but with the current meta; it has been too often weak.
-> Doom Blade / Go for the throat.

4 BSZ seems a bit too much main board... Instead, I'm going to run 1 Blue Sun's Zenith
And put the 4th BSZ in the side

Finally, I was too often color screwed.. lack of blue src.
So -2 Swamp +2 Island

Toward v1.1:
------------

After play testing it a bit... 

The deck needs to be able to answer the creatures...
Also: I think duress works better here than distress.
