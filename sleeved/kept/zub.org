Version 1.50:
-------------
Update of the sideboard:
-1 Sword of Feast and Famine
-1 Black Sun's Zenith
+1 Sever the Bloodline
+1 Phyrexian Metamorph

Version 1.42:
-------------
-2 Skirsdag High Priest
+2 Altar's Reap
Swap the swords between SB and MB -- W&P seems more appropriate.

Version 1.41:
-------------
SB changes:
-1 Negate
+1 Phantasmal Image

Against some of the match up I really want to have 4 image on board


Post FNM:
---------
The deck did really well in the FNM.  I won the tournament.
Round 1 against Heartless Summoning: 2-1
Round 2 against Mono black Zombie 2-1
Round 3 against UW delver/spirit 2-1
Round 4 against RW humans 2-0
Round 5 against UW mage-blade 2-0


Version v1.4:
-------------
3 Corrosive Gale may be too much; Down to 2 replacing the third one by a BSZ
Also going to remove 1 Negate for a Reaper; in some match up; it may becomes useful to extract creature from their graveyard


Version v1.3:
-------------
Altar's Reap got removed... 
Having too many in hand wasn't a good thing.

Introduction of the Swords in the deck.
So far I'm not sure how useful they can be; but they definitively helped in some games.

Land count got increased to 22 from 20.  
With 20 lands, I felt that it was holding the deck too much.
(probably because the decks run 10+ 3CMC spells)


Version 1.2:
------------

+2 Skirsdag High Priest
-1 Lili
-1 Island

Skirsdag has proven himself very very good!
Including against Red/Green decks.

I don't feel like BSZ should even be in the Sideboard.
Also, as much as the obliterator was nice to draw, drawing too many hurts.
Note sure about Geralf either -- 4 seems too many.

Phantasmal Image has been awesome!!! Copying an undying creature is the best! :)
Considering upping the count.

Mortapod was also great! Not sure about 3 though...


Toward 1.1:
-----------

Even w/ 22 land it's feels like I was drawing too many lands..
Going down to 21 land for the next version

Phantasmal Image is great in this deck -> going up to 3 or 4 or him.

To help the draw, I wonder if the deck shouldn't run: ponder or Gitaxian Probe...

Flying is a big weakness right now -> Going to run 3 or 4 Corrosive Gate in the Side.
Vapor Snag could be an a good sideboard card too.
Potentially 2/3 Surgical Extraction against all undying guys.


Version 1.0:
------------

Very fun fast paste aggro deck, however, the SB needs a lot of works.
So far, only sure points: RB.
