+--------------------------------------------------


v1.00 -> v1.01:
---------------
Sideboard change:
-1 Tragic Slip
+1 Putrefy
-1 Gaze of the Granite
+1 Blood Baron of Vizkopa

v0.90 -> v1.00:
---------------
Mainboard changes:
-1 Doom Blade
+1 Putrefy
-1 Woodland Cemetary
+1 Temple Garden


v0.80 -> v0.90:
---------------
Mainboard changes:
-3 Cartel Aristocrat
+3 Deathrite Shaman


v0.70 -> v0.80:
---------------
Mainboard changes:
-3 Blood Artist
-1 Cartel Aristocrat
+4 Fiendslayer Paladin


Version 0.70-beta:
------------------
Currently I didn't have a fourth Lifebane Zombie, nor a second Obzedat.
Instead I boarded in: 2 Desecration Demon in order to better face control decks.

I went to an local FNM, 16 people, 4 rounds.

Round 1: 2/0 against a WG token/populate deck.
It wasn't too much of a fight.  Playing the proper kill spell at the right time did the trick.
I didn't use the sideboard for game 2.

Round 2: 2/0 against UR pyromancer-control
- Game 1: after killing multiple of his pyromancer; I was able to land a Scavenging Ooze and eat enough creature to keep him out of reach of any red kill spell.
Gavony Township was quite useful to make him grown even more.  Even his Chandra's Phoenix ended up in the Ooze's stomach.  
- Game 2: I sideboarded Duress and Underworld Connection and took out mostly Blood Artist. 
Unfortunately for him; he got stuck with just U mana for too long.  Voice of Resurgence + Lingering Soul and later on a Archangel of Thune sealed the game.

Round 3: 1/1 against UWR control:
- Game 1: Sorin and Township were the kings of the hill.  I created several Vampire token and use Gavony to increase their power/toughness... 
I finish Game 1 with 50 life.  It was fun to use Sorin's ultimate on Aetherling and two 1/1 tokens in order to clear the path for my attack.
- Game 2: Sideboarded: Duress, Underworld Connection, Desecrated Demon.  But were unable to draw kill spells.  Two Restoration Angels managed to finish me up.
I did some mistakes during this game.  One of them was: I was too affraid to cast spell such as Underworld Connection thinking he may have had some counters.
Trying to be overprotective did slow me -- Also, I was stuck at 3 mana for too long (Underworld Connection would definitively have helped) + I didnt' draw a single kill spell.

Round 4: 2/1 against BG control.
This was a very fun deck to play against.
- Game 1: Even though I knew it wasn't good against black creatures; in this game I paid the price: turn 4, Desecrated Demon follow by a turn 5: Vraska, I knew the game was over. 
I keep playing a bit in order to learn a bit more about his deck.  But I knew it was a lost cause, stuck with two Doom Blade in hand.  He played mutilate to get rid of my Lingering Soul tokin and my Voice or Resource.  
Also casted Disciple of Bolar to draw 6 cards out of the Demon. 
- Game 2: Massive sideboard change: -3 Doom Blade, -3 Lifebane Zombie and 5 other cards to board every thing in except for Gaze and Golgari Charms.
I kept him in check while applying presure with Scavenging Ooze and later with Lingering Soul.
A well placed duress allowed me to see that he was also runing Thragtusk.
- Game 3: My initial opening hand was 5 laands, 1 Bloodartist and 1 duress; I decided to mull, to get a 6 cards hand with just one plain.  At 5 cards, I had no lands... Thanksfully (if I may say), my opponent also mulled down to 4 cards. 
He proposed to call this turn game a tie so we would both be able to redraw 7.  I refused, since he had a based control deck.  Even if 4 was low.  My thoughts were that he would be more penalized than me.
I believe we both ended up keeping a 2 land hand.  My hand was: 2 lands, 1 Voice of Resurgence and 1 Obzedat.  
He played a turn 2 Ooze; and I was lucky to draw Abrupt Decay.  Then while I was getting flooded by lands, he was stuck at 2 for a while; allow me to cast Obzedat which with the help of Voice helped me finishing the game.
By the time he reached 4 mana he was quite low in life.   A duress took away the putrefy he was keeping to get rid of Obzedat, during the attack phase, he Abrupt decay my Voice; giving me two tokens.   At this point the game was over.

I finished at the second place with the same amount of points than the person I tied against during Round 3 (It was unfortunate, my first oppponent dropped after the second round which lowered my overall score).

Regarding the current state of the deck:
- Lifebane Zombie is really good main board.
- Desecrated Demon was just bad.  Didn't fit the roll I had for him -- Granted it was a place holder anyway.
- I'm not sure if blood artist fits in the deck.  Aside from him; all my creature are good by themselves... Blood artist is a terrible top deck card when the board is clean.
(even Aristocrat is good, a 2/2 for 2 which can gain protection isn't too bad -- still a bit questionable)

For the next version of the deck, I'm going to try to replace Blood Artist by Fiendslayer Paladin.


v0.60 -> v0.70:
---------------
Mainboard:
-1 Blood Artist
+1 Scavenging Ooze

Sideboard:
+1 Lifebane Zombie
+1 Obzedat, Ghost Council
+1 Tragic Slip


Version 0.60:
-------------
The change has definitively improves the deck.
So many UWR or BRG decks that this Lifebane Zombie is almost always useful!

Regarding the three opened slot in the Graveyard:
- I feel like a fourth Lifebane Zombie may be to consider.  That card provide such a great benefits against Jund.
- For the two other slots: 3 potential options
  . Frontline Medic (mostly to counter X-costed spells): however for a control deck it's fairly easy to play around it.
  . Sin Collector: which already feels a better option than Frontline Medic -- but can be redundant w/ Duress
  . Path of Bravery: I like the idea of this card in the sideboard -- If the deck isn't too aggro the chance of having the life above their is high.


v0.50 -> v0.60: ** <HERE>
---------------
Mainboard:
-3 Skirsdag High Priest
+3 Lifebane Zombie

Sideboard:
-3 Lifebane Zombie
+3 ??? [Open slots]

Version 0.50:
-------------
Jund (BGR) is very popular and creature do not live long...
Skirsdag becomes less and less triggerable.

I'm going to start mainboarding: Lifebane Zombie which I'm always please to see.
Leaving 3 open slot for the sideboard -- To be determined.


v0.41 -> v0.50:
---------------
-2 Vault of the Archangel
+2 Gavony Township

Version 0.41:
-------------
Control deck are very annoying.
The deck has too many 1/1s and 2/2s

Also: I barely use Vault of the Archangel anymore.
Township seems more appropriate for the deck.


v0.40 -> v0.41:
---------------
Sideboard updates:
-1 Gaze of Granite
+1 Underworld Connections


v0.32 -> v0.40:
---------------
Mainboard changes:
-3 Deathrite Shaman
+3 Scavenging Ooze


Version v0.32:
--------------
I'm wondering if Scavenger Ooze would not be a better fit than Deathrite Shaman.
It doesn't deals life damage when removing a spell; but it target any cards.  And can do it multiple times a turn.
Tough choice.

Deathrite Shaman has two advantages over Scavenger Ooze:
- he's black and therefore cannot be targetted bu Doom Blade.
- he cost 1 and can be a good turn 1 drop

Scavenging Ooze has on the other hand its own benefits:
- Can be activated the turn you play it.
- Can become a serious threat as he will grow overtime.

Overall, the deck doesn't rely on turn 1 play.
I think it's better to try it out and see how it feels.


v0.31 -> v0.32:
---------------
-2 Oblivion Ring
-1 Liliana of the Veil
+1 Golgari Charm
+2 Tragic Slip


Version 0.31:
-------------
Golgari Charm is really nice in this deck.
On the other hand, O-Ring doesn't fit the build


v0.30 -> v0.31:
---------------
Sideboard:
-1 Liliana of the Veil
-1 Ray of Revelation
+2 Golgari Charm


v0.22 -> v0.30:
---------------
Mainboard:
-2 Liliana of the Veil
+1 Deathrite Shaman
+1 Putrefy

Sideboard:
-1 Deathrite Shaman
-1 Putrefy
+2 Liliana of the Veil


v0.21 -> v0.22:
---------------
Sideboard change:
+1 Obzedat, Ghost Council
-1 Blood Baron of Vizkopa


v0.20 -> v0.21:
---------------
Sideboard change:
-2 Vraska the Unseen
+2 Gaze of Granite


Version 0.20:
-------------
Well... I just face an elf decks... 
And boy it's really hard...
I think the deck needs some board sweep in the side...
Like: Gaze of Granite


v0.13 -> v0.20:
---------------
Mainboard:
-1 Abrupt Decay
+1 Putrefy

Sideboard:
-2 Devour Flesh
-1 Ray of Revelation
+1 Putrefy
+2 Oblivion Ring


Version v0.13:
--------------
One potential issue with this deck:
The deck cannot deal with black creature over 3CMC (aside from Lilina)

This include (but is not limited to):
- Blood Baron of Vizkopa: 
- Obzedat, Ghost Council
- Falkenrath Aristocrat
- Olivia Voldaren
- Sire of Insanity
- Vampire Nocturnus
(also:)
- Corpsejack Menace
- Bloodline Keeper
- Desecration Demon
- Griselbrand
- Master of Cruelties
- Mikaeus, the Unhallowed 
- Necropolis Regent
- Shadowborn Demon

The sideboard should be updated for it.
Option:
- Tragic Slip
- Oblivion Ring
- Putrefy
- Orzhov Charm (with potentially high cost)
- Plummet (for flying)
(Note: No easy way to take care of Blood Baron)


v0.12 -> v0.13:
---------------
-3 Sin Collector
+1 Lifebane Zombie
+2 Devour Flesh


Version v0.12:
--------------
I feel like I need more way to kill creatures.
Sin Collector in the sideboard double the use of Duress which overall is more versatile.


v0.11 -> v0.12:
---------------
Sideboard:
-1 Blood Baron of Vizkopa
+1 Deathrite Shaman


Version v0.11:
--------------
The deck works really well so far.
I'm still concern about Control match up.
Currently considering updating the sideboard...


v0.1 -> v0.11:
--------------
Sideboard:
-2 Ratchet Bomb
+2 Ray of Revelation
