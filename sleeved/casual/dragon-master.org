v1.4 -> v1.5:
-------------
-1 Mountain
+1 Cavern of Souls


v1.3 -> v1.4:
-------------
-1 Mountain
+1 Cavern of Souls


Version 1.3:
------------
After initial playtest:
+ Inquizition of Kozilek is really good
+ Dark ritual helps a lot early game.
+ Graven Cairn is quite useful

Sometimes I wish I had a way to give the dragon shroud... 

Dark Ritual Turn 1: often not very good.
On turn 3 this is where it shines -- Sometimes on turn 2.
But... Not quite convinced yet.

The number of swamp should be increased -- It is sometimes very important to be able to cast IoK on turn 1.
Two or three more swamp (and maybe a forth Graven land.

- 

OK, the nice thing about dark ritual is that it's easier to get 5 mana w/ splash black or red.
Keeping it for now.


v1.2 -> v1.3:
-------------
-2 Seeting Song
-1 Rakdos Signet
+3 Dark Ritual

-1 Whispering Cloak
+1 Inquisition of Kozilek

-1 Swamp
-2 Lavaclaw Reaches
+3 Graven Cairns


Version 1.2:
------------
Inquisition of Kozilek made a real difference to the deck.
Considering the Dragon are high CMC; it also helps knowing what your opponent has in hand + removing a control spell (counter/kill...) works really well.

I also noticed that; even if: Seething Song increase the mana for a turn by 2. 
I often have 1 open mana after casting my dragon; i.e: it effectively only increases the mana count by 1.
The 3 CMC is the main reason for this drawback.

Considering replacing it by: Dark Ritual -- However, in that case; a mana fixer seems appropriate.
A card like Graven Cairns could really help.

Regarding other existing cards:
+ Thundermaw Hellkite is really a key cards; tapping all potential flyers in order to leave the field open for the dragon to strike (an extra one may be good to consider)
- Lavaclaw Reaches: as a dual mana producer; it's fine (except that it always enters the battlefield tapped) however, as 'creature land' it does't cut it.  Too weak.


v1.1 -> v1.2:
-------------
-3 Dragonspeaker Shaman
+3 Inquisition of Kozilek


Version v1.1:
-------------
The changes were good.  The deck is a lot stronger than before.
Still fairly weak to control and/or black kill+sacr spells.

One thing to consider:
-3 Dragonspeaker Shaman
+3 Inquisition of Kozilek


v1.0 -> v1.1:
-------------
-1 Bladewin the Risen
-1 Flameblast Dragon
+2 Thundermaw Hellkite
-3 Magmaquake
+3 Bonfire of the Damned
-1 Dragonspeaker Shaman
+1 Urza's Incubator


Toward 1.1:
-----------
I'm considering removing both:
-1 Bladewin the Risen
-1 Flameblast Dragon
And add: 
+2 Thundermaw Hellkite

Also adding an extra Cavern or 2 would be nice
Finally: +1 Urza's Incubator and -1 Dragonspeaker is also an interresting option.


v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-4 Everflowing Chalice
+4 Rakdos Signet


Version 0.9:
------------
The deck is so much more consistent.
Urza's Incubator is very nice.
Definitively a good addision to the deck.
Deck remains vulnerable to control
-> Maybe 1 more cavern.
Not sure about Bladewing the Risen -- Definitively no more than 1.

Considering replacing of Chalice by Rakdos Signet.


v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-1 Crucible of Fire
-2 Mudbutton
+3 Urza's Incubator

-1 Archwing Dragon
-2 Dragon Whelp
+1 Balefire Dragon
+1 Bogardan Hellkite
+1 Kilnmouth Dragon

-1 Hoardsmelter
+1 Whispersilk Cloak

-1 Thunder Dragon
-1 Mordant Dragon
+1 Bladewin the Risen
+1 Flameblast Dragon


Toward v0.9:
------------
Some dragons to consider:
. Thundermaw Hellkite
. Bladewin the Risen (3BBRR - return a dragon to play...) 

Still considering green as a third color...
For:
. Karthus, Tyran of Jund
. Bloodmother


v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-3 Mountain
+2 Lavaclaw Reaches
+1 Cavern of Soul


Version v0.7:
-------------
Magmaquake is really nice.
The instant speed effect is really worth it.


v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-3 Bonfire of the Damned
+3 Magmaquake


Towards v0.7:
-------------
The deck is mostly worried about swarming land creatures... and potentially planeswalkers.
Replacing Bonfire by Magmaquake seems a very interesting option.
No more Miracle drawbacks AND instant speed effeect.

The two downsides:
. it will hits the Dragonspeaker shaman... and potentially Sarkhan
. it doesn't touch flying creatures -> BUT the dragons should be able to take care of that.


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Captive Flame
+1 Crucible of Fire


v0.4 -> v0.5
------------
-1 Punishing Fire
-2 Pyroclasm
-2 Red Sun's Zenith
-1 Slagstorm
-4 Lightning Bolt
-11 Mountain
+4 Blood Crypt
+4 Dragonskull Summit
+3 Swamp


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
+4 Lightning Bolt
-1 Breath of Darigaaz
-1 Spitting Earth
-1 Ghostfire
-1 Seismic Strike


Version 0.3:
------------
Mmm... The deck is fun; but I think the killspell needs to be updated.
