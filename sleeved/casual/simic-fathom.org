v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-1 Bird of Paradise
+1 Plaxmanta Frogling

Version 0.9:
------------
Primordial Hydra made such a difference!!! WoW... 
Which now makes me question the use of Zameck Guildmage.

Note: I tried Simic Charm instead -> not really good.
Guildmage is quite good as it will potentially draw me cards if they tried to kill one of my creature :)
Also: I can gain control of their creature and draw cards from it OR reduce the Fathom Mage power to guarantee a evolve trigger.

I feel like: I should run definitively run 4 plaxmanta frogling and maybe 4 hydra 

v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-3 Protean Hydra
+3 Primordial Hydra

Version 0.8:
------------
I'm wondering if Simic Charm would not be better than 'Into the Roil'
It's true that Into the Roil will bounce planeswalker, and other non pleasant art/ench....
But Simic Charm can protect and beef up creatures.
Well... Plaxcaster is also good to protect.  Not sure.

In the future, if I can get another playset of Hinterland Harbor:
-1 Forest
-3 Island
+4 Hinterland Harbor

v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-1 Experimen Kraj
+1 Fathom Mage

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Evolution Vat
+1 Plaxcaster Frogling

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Novijen, Heart of Progress 
+2 Oran-Rief, the Vastwood
-3 Evolving Wilds
+4 Breeding Pools
-2 Simic Growth Chamber


Regarding v0.5:
---------------
The most annoying part in the deck was the lands...
Evolving Wild is just terrible... :( It hurts too much...


v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-3 Cytoshape
+3 Into the Roil
-3 Snakeform
+1 Fact or Fiction
+1 Remand
+1 Zamech Guildmage

Results with v0.4:
------------------
Fact or Fiction -> AWESOME!!!
I don't think Cytoshape is that neat in this deck
Somehting like: Into the Roil is probably much better

Zameck Guildmage + Protean Hidra => SCHWEEET!

v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-2 Jace's Ingenuity
+2 Fact or Fiction
