Version v0.6:
-------------
After a few game, I'm already loving two of the newly added cards: Maelstrom Pulse and Research // Development; both of them did wonders.
Not convinced yet by 'Call to Heel'...  I need more test. I may also replace it by 2 more "See Beyond"

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-4 Beast Within
+4 Maelstrom Pulse
-2 Last Stand
+2 Research // Development
+2 Call to Heel
-2 Arc Trail

Version v0.5:
-------------
Not being able to easily deal with the 3/3 Beast makes Beast Within not very appealing to cast.
Also: Don't quite like Last Stand either... Kind of a 'I win' card.

Note: I'm going to try Call to Heel instead of Arc Trail, not sure if that's a good compromise.



v0.4 -> 0.5:
------------
-1 Terramorphic Expanse
+1 Vivid Grove
-1 Pillar of the Parums
+1 Vivid Grag
-1 Steam Vent
+1 Vivid Grove

Version 0.4:
------------
Land to consider:
- Tendo Ice Bridge


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-2 Shimmering Grotto
-1 Rupture Spire
-1 Mountain
+2 Raging Ravine
+1 Pillar of the Parums
+1 Steam Vent

Version 0.3:
------------
Without G in the starting hand; it's a real gamble...
I think some better lands should be added. :)
Aka: rav duals.


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-2 Island
+2 Forst

Version 0.2:
------------
The deck is a pure blast!
Beck // Call is fantastic!
However, need more green mana source...
