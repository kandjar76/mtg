Version v1.1:
-------------
The deck needs draw spell or recuring effect :-)

v1.0 -> v1.1:
-------------
-2 Daybreak Ranger
-1 Instigator Gang
+1 Duskwatch Recruiter
+2 Breadneck Rider
-2 Moon Mist
+2 Geier Reach Bandit


v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-2 Huntmaster of the Fell
-2 Domri Rade
+4 Village Messenger

v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-3 Magma Jet
-1 Full Moon's Rise
+4 Collected Company


Ideally:
--------
-1 Coppreline Gorge
-1 Rootbound Crag
-1 Forest
-1 Mountain
+4 Wooded Foothills

v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-2 Green Sun's Zenith
+2 Domri Rade

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Gatstaf Shepherd
+1 Daybreak Ranger

In recent games; I often wish to draw teh daybreak ranger...
At the same time, I wans't exited to draw Gatstaf.

Overall, it's a small adjustment... But it should pay off.

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-2 Garruk Relentless
+2 Green Sun's Zenith

Green Sun's Zenith has been a very helpful card in the playtest I did.
Overall: better than Garruk

Toward Verion 0.6:
------------------
I'd also like to try: 
-2 Garruk 
+2 Green Sun's Zenith
or
+2 Beast Within
But I think Overall: I want 2 Domri in this deck.

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-2 Incinerate
+1 Lightning Bolt
+1 Magma Jet

v0.3 -> v0.4
------------
-4 Wolfbitten Captive
-1 Mondronen Shaman
+3 Gatstaf Shepherd 
+2 Immerwolf
+1 Kruin Outlaw
-1 Instigator Gang

Version 0.3:
------------
The scry2 ability provided by magma set is a huge help!
I'm actually wondering if I should not increase the count ot it.

Some artifacts:
- Engineered Explosives
- Ratchet Bomb
Are brutal against this deck... :(
I'm wondering the best way to stop those... (and if any are maindeckable...)

Answer: 
- Null Rod       [Not modern legal -- And soo specific that it shouldn't be mainboarded...]
- Pithing Needle [Maybe... Considering that it could stall a planeswalker too...]

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Incinerate
-1 Lightning Bolt
+2 Magma Jet


Version v0.2:
-------------
A lot more fun!
Another card I just found and may be considered: Magma Set


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
Moonmist is a must! Need 4-of!

Changes:

-4 Forest
-4 Mountain
+4 Copperline Gorge
+4 Rootbound Crag 

+1 Full Moon's Rise
+1 Moonmist
-1 Immerwolf
-1 Deranged Outcast

-3 Immerwolf
-4 Brimstone Valley
+4 Lightning Bolt
+3 Incinerate

To try:
-1 Kruin Outlaw
+1 Moondronen Shaman



After inital try-out:
---------------------
Deck seems to have something to it.
Not quite fun yet... but not bad enough to just toss it out.
