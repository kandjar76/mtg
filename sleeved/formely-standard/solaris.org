Toward v2.7:
------------
Going a bit less counter-spell oriented since most control/tempo deck will out-race this deck in term of counter spells.
Keeping the number of creature low is on the other hand much more important (for lili's performance).

Another thing I'd like to remove is surgical extraction.
It's great when it works.. But you cannot rely on it. (due to mental mistep)
Where as Nihil Spellbomb is actually a cantrip at the very lease.

Main board:
-2 Dissipate
+2 Tragic Slip

Sideboard:
-1 Virulent Wound (replaced by Tragic Slip)
-1 Phantasmal Image (no room for it)
-1 Spellskite (never sb in -- maybe against Wolf Run... But so far, I'd rather a kill spell than that)
-2 Surgical Extraction
+1 White Sun Zenith (against control)
+1 Archon of Justice
+1 Negate
+2 Tribute to Hunger (against dekvers)
-1 Karn Liberated
+1 Black Sun's Zenith

Note that I'm gonna try Archon again (sb option); I'm still debating with the Havengul Lich.
Since I did like it when I first played with it; I'm going to stick wth it.

--

Post reflection, that could be really bad if my opponent cast Phantasmal Image and copy it.
Alright, back to Havengul Lich then.
-1 Archon of Justice
+1 Havengul Lich

Change of SB again:
-1 Havengul Lich
+1 Bloodline Keeper
If I'm going to play with the lich it needs to be MB.
Going to try the bloodline keeper instead; I like the idea of spawning 2/2 every turn...

--

Finally land readjustment: since I remove dissipate; I don't need 2/3 blue very early on...
However I felt a lack of white mana... 
-1 Island
+1 Isolated Chapel
Also: with the previous mana base; I don't even know if 'even' one WSZ was viable.


Version 2.6:
---------------------------------
Running BSZ main deck is actually a lot better than DoJ against most decks.
You often needs to wrath on turn 3 to be safe... and 1 -1c is also usually enough to clear the board.


Toward 2.5:
---------------------------------
Well I'm not sure about Unburial rites....
Let's try w/ Ponder instead.
-1 Phantasmal Image
-1 Unburial Rites
-1 Virulent Wound
-1 Dissipate
+1 Forbidden Alchemy
+3 Ponder

Version 2.4:
---------------------------------
Back to the source...
Removing think twice, putting snappy back in the deck...
Trying 1 more unburial rites...

Toward 2.3:
---------------------------------
Deck needs to land mana each turn.... 
I don't think snappy was actually that good in this deck... Sure it has been useful...
But: I feel like Think Twice may benefits the deck more.

Between Think Twice and Ponder, I believe ponder is better to search for an answer, but since I'm not going to use snappy... 
I think TT will be better overall... Because of its flashback


Post tournament with v2.2:
---------------------------------
Very small tournament 6 people only.
I faced: UR delver first game; RB and Wurmcoil were keys to the game.
Game 2: was against a pod deck; I was mana screwed all 3 games...
 - I realized that a hand with 4+ mana isn't that bad with this deck.
Game 3: against UG human... 
 It was OK, the deck had enough kill to keep my opponent in check until Elesh norn hit plays.

Note: I'm still doing lots of mistakes with the deck.


Update for 2.1
---------------------------------
I think RB in the main board is going to be a bit more versatile than a DOJ.
Going from 3 DOJ in MB and 2 RB in SB to: 2 DOJ + 1 RB in MB and 1 DOJ + 1 RB in the SB

Another option I'd like to consider is a 1 CMC kill spell -- either "Dead Weight" or "Wring Flesh" as a 2-of, 
either MB or SB.

Other change to try:
-1 Archon of Justice (MB)
-1 Sun Titan (MB)
-1 Wurmcoil Engine (SB)
+1 Wurmcoil Engine (MB)
+1 Wring Flesh (MB)
+1 Wring Flesh (SB)
+1 Archon of Justice (SB)


Toward v2.0
---------------------------------
I think the deck needs more creatures...
Even countered, killed they'll come back through Unburial Rites.
The deck doesn't have to be so Graveyard reluctant.

Considering: 2 Surgical Extraction in the SB -- Against controls and their swarm of counters...

Post tournament with v1.5:
---------------------------------
The deck did well against aggro... 
- Beat wolf run round 1
- Beat a mono blue deck round 2
- Tied with Solaris control round 3
- Lost 1-0 against UW control round 4

Overall the deck is fun, but too slow, and still a bit inconsistent in term of answers.
I would probably need to readjust the mana a bit: -1 Swamp +1 Plain if I keep the deck as it.

However, I'm considering switching it toward a more tempo deck.
Laying a early threat (1 CMC turn 1 or 2 CMC turn 4), and attacking with it...

Ironically the deck seems to be lacking Counters.
Also: I wonder if I should keep Unburial Rites -- I was almost always able to cast the big threats.


Thoughts regarding v1.2
---------------------------------
Looking at the SB... I'm not satisfied.
  Wolf Run
    +1 Spellskite
    +2 Flash Freeze
    +1 Doom Blade
    -2 O-Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  Township Tokens
    +2 Ratchet Bomb
    +1 Day of Judgement
    -1 O-Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  Red Deck Wins
    +1 Doom Blade
    +2 Celestial Purge
    +1 Mental Misstep (if posible)
    +2 Flash Freeze
    -2 Mana Leak
    -1 Illusion
    -3 Liliana
  MB Infect
    +2 Celestial Purge
  UW Control
    -1 Day of Judgement
    -2 Mental Misstep
    +2 Jace MA
    +1 O-Ring
  Solar Flare
    +2 Jace MA
    +2 Drownyard 
    -2 Mental Misstep
    -2 lands
  Tempered Steel
    +1 Day of Judgement
    +2 Ratchet Bomb??
    +1 Oblivion Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  RU Illusions
    +2 Celestial Purge
    -2 Mental Misstep
  UW Delver/Illusions
    +1 Doom Blade
    +1 Mental Misstep
    -2 Oblivion Ring

So far:
 +1 Spellskite
 +2 Flash Freeze
 +2 Ratchet Bomb
 +1 Day of Judgement
 +1 Doom Blade
 +2 Celestial Purge
 +1 Mental Misstep
 +2 Jace Memory Adept
 +2 Drownyard
 +1 Oblivion Ring

No Timely reinforcement.
No Pacifism
No Spellbomb either...

Because the deck is already running O-Ring...
I don't see the point of having the 2 revoke existence in the SB.


Toward v1.2:
---------------------------------
MB:
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon

SB:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 Pacifism
-3 Surfical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb
+1 Spellskite

Thoughts regarding v1.1
---------------------------------
Considering SB change:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 one of:
 Jace, Memory Adept? -- against control?
 Ratchet Bomb? -- one more?
 Divine Offering? 
 Karn?
 Spellskite

Also to try MB: 
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
(I'm a bit concerned about the extra mana in the cost -- But great to grab the 1-ofs)

Somewhere:
+1 Pacifism?
Maybe SB with -1 Surfical Extraction
I don't think I'd want to main board 2 SE, for the same reason that I took out 1 Timely reinforcement...

SB Change to also consider:
-2 Surgical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb


Toward v1.1:
---------------------------------
-1 Mana Leak
-1 Forbidden Alchemy
-1 Doom Blade
+3 Think Twice

-1 Seachrome Coast
-1 Drowned Catacomb
-1 Isolated Chapel

+3 Island
+1 Swamp
-1 White
