+2 Green Sun's Zenith
+1 Qasily Pridemage
+1 Basilisk Colar

Version 0.2 Post play-test:
---------------------------
Much more fun than the original version.
However, I feel that I need the deck to be more focus.

Suggestion to add:
- Basilisk Collar + Probably some fetch artifact
- Green sun Zenith.
- Maybe more creatures...
- More Raking Canopy
