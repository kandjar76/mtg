Which made me want to try this deck again:
- Zephyr Charge

One major change to do: adding a third color to this deck.

Cards to removed:
- Raking Canopy: this cards doesn't work really well -> giving a creature flying MUST be done before declared as attacker.
- Flying Carpet: Zephyr Charge is much more appropriate as it comes into play a lot sooner or will have mana to spare.
- Selesnya Charm: doesn't seem to be suited here.
- Sol Ring: unnecessary here.


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Green Sun's Zenith
+1 Basilisk Colar

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
+1 Raqking Canopy
+2 Green Sun's Zenith
+1 Qasily Pridemage
+1 Basilisk Colar 
-2 Elspeth Knight Errant
-2 Garruk Wildspeaker
-1 Marsh Flat

-2 Marsh Flat
-2 Misty Rainforst
+4 Sunpetal Grove

Version 0.2 Post play-test:
---------------------------
Much more fun than the original version.
However, I feel that I need the deck to be more focus.

Suggestion to add:
- Basilisk Collar + Probably some fetch artifact
- Green sun Zenith.
- Maybe more creatures...
- More Raking Canopy
