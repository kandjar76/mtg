Idea:

 - Madness is fun
 - I can use: Stronarm Tactics in that deck
 - As well as Delirium Skeins.

 The deck is most likely going to be Multicolor, 
 Black and either Blue, Green, or Red.
 Need to ckeck the madness cards.

 Green has the: Wild Mongrel which enable easy madness.
 Idea: need to be able to discard as an instant!

So far: added madness cards, and cards to trigger it.
Very strong card: Arrogant Wurm!

So far: three color decks: BUG!

24 creats!
15 spells
21 land
