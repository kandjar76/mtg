v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
Main:
-1 Dissipate
-1 Jace, Architect of Thought
+2 Pillar of Flame

Sideboard:
-2 Curse of Death's Hold
+2 Pillar of Flame

Initial Playtest of v0.1:
-------------------------
The deck is quite fun to play with.
Weak against zombie and probably aggro in general -> needs Pillar of Flame!!
