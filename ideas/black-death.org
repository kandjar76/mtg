v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
Considering:
-3 Liliana
+2 Batterskull
+1 Damnation

[So I wouldn't have to buy any card for this deck :P -- Even if turn 1 lili is quite brutal]
[But Liliana + Phyrexian Arena works sooo great together...]

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-2 Vampire Nighthawk
+2 Phyrexian Metamorph
