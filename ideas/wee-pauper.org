Version 0.31:
-------------
Sideboard added.


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-4 Turn aside
+4 Dispell
-2 Artful Dodge
+2 Terramorphic expance
-1 Assault Probe
-2 Wee Dragonauts
+3 Brainstorm


Version 0.2:
------------
Boring...
Ironically, I've been either land screwed or land flooded.
Thinking about going back to 20 lands... still
Also: too many cards which are creature dependent...


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-3 Echoing Truth
+2 Electrickery
+1 Turn Aside
-3 Fling
-3 Distortion Strike
+2 Artful Dodge
+4 Lightning Bolt
-2 Island
-2 Mountain
+4 Delver of Secrets

Comments on v0.1:
-----------------
The original version did have a clear lack of creatures...
The addition of delver should help.

Replaceing Echoing Truth main board by some lightning bolt, as well as electrickery... 
Distortion strike is good... but the rebound is rarely effective.... -> Artful Dodge seems more appropriate.

Fling is quite useless... Much better to have more spells...

The deck seems to have way too much lands...
