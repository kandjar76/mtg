Toward 2.5:
---------------------------------
Well I'm not sure about Unburial rites....
Let's try w/ Ponder instead.
-1 Phantasmal Image
-1 Unburial Rites
-1 Virulent Wound
-1 Dissipate
+1 Forbidden Alchemy
+3 Ponder

Version 2.4:
---------------------------------
Back to the source...
Removing think twice, putting snappy back in the deck...
Trying 1 more unburial rites...

Toward 2.3:
---------------------------------
Deck needs to land mana each turn.... 
I don't think snappy was actually that good in this deck... Sure it has been useful...
But: I feel like Think Twice may benefits the deck more.

Between Think Twice and Ponder, I believe ponder is better to search for an answer, but since I'm not going to use snappy... 
I think TT will be better overall... Because of its flashback


Post tournament with v2.2:
---------------------------------
Very small tournament 6 people only.
I faced: UR delver first game; RB and Wurmcoil were keys to the game.
Game 2: was against a pod deck; I was mana screwed all 3 games...
 - I realized that a hand with 4+ mana isn't that bad with this deck.
Game 3: against UG human... 
 It was OK, the deck had enough kill to keep my opponent in check until Elesh norn hit plays.

Note: I'm still doing lots of mistakes with the deck.


Update for 2.1
---------------------------------
I think RB in the main board is going to be a bit more versatile than a DOJ.
Going from 3 DOJ in MB and 2 RB in SB to: 2 DOJ + 1 RB in MB and 1 DOJ + 1 RB in the SB

Another option I'd like to consider is a 1 CMC kill spell -- either "Dead Weight" or "Wring Flesh" as a 2-of, 
either MB or SB.

Other change to try:
-1 Archon of Justice (MB)
-1 Sun Titan (MB)
-1 Wurmcoil Engine (SB)
+1 Wurmcoil Engine (MB)
+1 Wring Flesh (MB)
+1 Wring Flesh (SB)
+1 Archon of Justice (SB)


Toward v2.0
---------------------------------
I think the deck needs more creatures...
Even countered, killed they'll come back through Unburial Rites.
The deck doesn't have to be so Graveyard reluctant.

Considering: 2 Surgical Extraction in the SB -- Against controls and their swarm of counters...

Post tournament with v1.5:
---------------------------------
The deck did well against aggro... 
- Beat wolf run round 1
- Beat a mono blue deck round 2
- Tied with Solaris control round 3
- Lost 1-0 against UW control round 4

Overall the deck is fun, but too slow, and still a bit inconsistent in term of answers.
I would probably need to readjust the mana a bit: -1 Swamp +1 Plain if I keep the deck as it.

However, I'm considering switching it toward a more tempo deck.
Laying a early threat (1 CMC turn 1 or 2 CMC turn 4), and attacking with it...

Ironically the deck seems to be lacking Counters.
Also: I wonder if I should keep Unburial Rites -- I was almost always able to cast the big threats.


Thoughts regarding v1.2
---------------------------------
Looking at the SB... I'm not satisfied.
  Wolf Run
    +1 Spellskite
    +2 Flash Freeze
    +1 Doom Blade
    -2 O-Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  Township Tokens
    +2 Ratchet Bomb
    +1 Day of Judgement
    -1 O-Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  Red Deck Wins
    +1 Doom Blade
    +2 Celestial Purge
    +1 Mental Misstep (if posible)
    +2 Flash Freeze
    -2 Mana Leak
    -1 Illusion
    -3 Liliana
  MB Infect
    +2 Celestial Purge
  UW Control
    -1 Day of Judgement
    -2 Mental Misstep
    +2 Jace MA
    +1 O-Ring
  Solar Flare
    +2 Jace MA
    +2 Drownyard 
    -2 Mental Misstep
    -2 lands
  Tempered Steel
    +1 Day of Judgement
    +2 Ratchet Bomb??
    +1 Oblivion Ring
    -2 Mental Misstep
  RU Illusions
    +2 Celestial Purge
    -2 Mental Misstep
  UW Delver/Illusions
    +1 Doom Blade
    +1 Mental Misstep
    -2 Oblivion Ring

So far:
 +1 Spellskite
 +2 Flash Freeze
 +2 Ratchet Bomb
 +1 Day of Judgement
 +1 Doom Blade
 +2 Celestial Purge
 +1 Mental Misstep
 +2 Jace Memory Adept
 +2 Drownyard
 +1 Oblivion Ring

No Timely reinforcement.
No Pacifism
No Spellbomb either...

Because the deck is already running O-Ring...
I don't see the point of having the 2 revoke existence in the SB.


Toward v1.2:
---------------------------------
MB:
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon

SB:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 Pacifism
-3 Surfical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb
+1 Spellskite

Thoughts regarding v1.1
---------------------------------
Considering SB change:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 one of:
 Jace, Memory Adept? -- against control?
 Ratchet Bomb? -- one more?
 Divine Offering? 
 Karn?
 Spellskite

Also to try MB: 
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
(I'm a bit concerned about the extra mana in the cost -- But great to grab the 1-ofs)

Somewhere:
+1 Pacifism?
Maybe SB with -1 Surfical Extraction
I don't think I'd want to main board 2 SE, for the same reason that I took out 1 Timely reinforcement...

SB Change to also consider:
-2 Surgical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb


Toward v1.1:
---------------------------------
-1 Mana Leak
-1 Forbidden Alchemy
-1 Doom Blade
+3 Think Twice

-1 Seachrome Coast
-1 Drowned Catacomb
-1 Isolated Chapel

+3 Island
+1 Swamp
-1 White
