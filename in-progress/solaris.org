Toward v1.2:
---------------------------------
MB:
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon

SB:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 Pacifism
-3 Surfical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb
+1 Spellskite

Thoughts regarding v1.1
---------------------------------
Considering SB change:
-1 Timely Reinforcement
+1 one of:
 Jace, Memory Adept? -- against control?
 Ratchet Bomb? -- one more?
 Divine Offering? 
 Karn?
 Spellskite

Also to try MB: 
+1 Rune-Scarred Demon
-1 Consecrated Sphinx
(I'm a bit concerned about the extra mana in the cost -- But great to grab the 1-ofs)

Somewhere:
+1 Pacifism?
Maybe SB with -1 Surfical Extraction
I don't think I'd want to main board 2 SE, for the same reason that I took out 1 Timely reinforcement...

SB Change to also consider:
-2 Surgical Extraction
+2 Nihil Spellbomb


Toward v1.1:
---------------------------------
-1 Mana Leak
-1 Forbidden Alchemy
-1 Doom Blade
+3 Think Twice

-1 Seachrome Coast
-1 Drowned Catacomb
-1 Isolated Chapel

+3 Island
+1 Swamp
-1 White
