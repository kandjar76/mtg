Post tournament comments:
--------------------------------------------------
The deck was really fun to play and felt well balanced.

Regarding the SB, I think it needs a slight update.
Sword of F&F should leave (if I don't put it the MB there's no reason to put it in the SB)
I'm still not sure about CtM or RB; A 4th BSZ may be welcome.


Changes 1.21 -> 1.30
--------------------------------------------------
-1 Contagion Engine
-2 Tezz Gambit
-3 Spellskite
-1 Phyrexian Metamorph
-1 Batterskull
-1 Drowned Catacomb
+2 Jace Beleren
+1 Life Finale
+2 Dismember
+3 Solemn Simulacrum
+1 Everflowing Chalice




Current considerations:
--------------------------------------------------
Replacing Tezz Gambit by Jace; but I'm a bit concerned about the 2 hard blue.
Adding 1 burried ruin to retrieved lost artifact.
--
Reconsidered: RB 1 in MB; and Solemn.


Changes 1.20 -> 1.21
--------------------------------------------------
-1 Tezzeret
+1 Contagion Engine.
The proliferate factor has proven to be very helpful during late games.

One question needs to be solved: did it switch the balance of the game around?



Note about 1.20:
--------------------------------------------------

Very fun deck to play.
The deck seems to have an answer to everything so far.
Still some problem with tempered steel when they start with the nuts hand... but overall very good.
I just wish they were more proliferate going on.
Maybe try to fit on Contagion Engine in the deck. (or clasp)



Note about 1.10:
--------------------------------------------------

I haven't received Consecrated Sphinx yet.
So I'm gonna try Tezzeret's Gambit instead -- It may do better that what I expect.
Also: I should try to find a spot to put 1 Life Finale in either the MB or the SB.


From 1.01 to 1.10:
--------------------------------------------------

Well even if they did help in some game; I think the sword needs to go.
Interesting fact: I always SBout solemn.
Also, I don't think IoK should stay.

Overall, the deck needs to be more control oriented.



WNM report using 1.01:
--------------------------------------------------

Round 1: UB Kodoltha -- lost 0/2
  Game 1: Descent starting hand, no improvement, no big creature, no tezz, no sword
    Game lasted too long -- he managed to pop Kudoltha despite the first being countered
  Game 2: Worst... Started with a descent hand: 2 lands, spellskite, skirge, IoK, Chalice... 
    Drew 10 lands in a row...

Round 2: Against GR Eldrazi... -- won 2/0
  The deck is based around ramping to 6 to cast Summoning Trap, or using: Quick Silver Amulet.
  Game 1: Deck didn't do much... I was able to keep control (I got lucky while countering Phyrexian Revoker -- he didn't have summoning trap)
  Game 2: SB in: Torpor Orb -- Out: Solemn
    Inkmoth equipped with a sword was what killed him

Round 3: Against UR Splinter/Shape Anew...
  Game 1: After IoK; I found out about the Splinter Twin combo; and saw 2 Shape Anew.
    Turn 1: I played IoK -- I found out about the Splinter Twin combo; and saw 2 Shape Anew.
    Turn 2: I played Spellskite
    Turn 3: He played Trinket Mage searching for his 0 CMC art indestructible...
    Turn 4: He casted Shape Anew -- I countered it.
    Turn 5: He casted it again; I redirected it to speellskite to pull tumble magnet.
    Next turn I played batterskull -- he scooped.
  Game 2: SB in: Torpor Orb + Spellskite - Out: Solemn.
    Turn 2: Orb
    Turn 3: Spellskite... 
    I had the control of the game at that point.

Round 4: Against another UR Splinter Twin/Titan -- won 2/0
  Roughtly the same.
  Torpor Orb + Spellskite ruined my opponent deck... Even Titan was useless.

Round 5: Final Against Red Kodoltha (only undefeated player) -- won 2/1
  Game1: Mull down to 5... Kept hand with 2 IoK, 2 Land and a Tumble Magnet.
    Didn't draw a single creature / counter / removal...
    I died quickly.
  Massive SB:
    Out: 2 Swords F&F, 1 Solemn, 3 Tumble Magnet, 2 Mana Leak, 1 Wurmcoil, 1 Metamorph
    In:  1 BSZ, 2 Spellskite, 2 Ratchet Bomb, 2 Mental misstep, 2 Spell pierce, 1 Sword of W&P
  Game2: 
    Very good starting hand: 1 Spellskite, 1 Mana leak, 1 Spell pierce, ...
    Turn 1: I played a island, pass -- He played 2 memnite, and casted Kudoltha, I spell pierced it... 
      That was the turn of the game.. Later, I played RB, to kill 2 memnite and Mox Opal...
      When down to 7 life; but then I casted Batterskull, and won.
  SB time: 
    I realized I shouldn't have taken out Mana leak.
    Out: 2 Sword of W&P
    In: 2 Mana leak
  Game 3:
    Opening hand: 2 Darkslick shore, 1 Creeping Tar pit, 1 Chalice, 1 BSZ, 1 Inkmoth Nexus, 1 Spellskite.
    I played the two chalice, then played chalice.
    He casted Jinxed Idol; sacr a creature to give it to me...
    Then he played another art, and kudoltha since I was tapped out.
    Next turn, I BSZ; later, I sacr Inkmoth to reutrn Jinxed... 
    Went down to 2 life, pulled it off thanks for batterskull and wurmcoil!
  Overall: in game 3, the winning card was definitively the chalice!, Thanks to the chalice, I could play every spell one turn ahead...
