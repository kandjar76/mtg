Deck v2.0: 
- First downside; no real Man land (3/4 w/ reach...)
- Fetch lands: Marsh Flats. Verdant Catacombs  -- Great for landfall.
  -> Land fall infect???
- Deck designed -- needs some play test!

Deck v1.0:
- After play-testing the deck; it didn't work at all.
The lack of mana didn't help at all.
The main issue; the deck is too slow while he want to be fast.
- Going toward: WGB instead of WUB.
Probably bringing the lotus cobra in!
