OOPS, MISSING ONE CARD!!!

Other cards to consider:
- replacing Necropede by "Plague Myr" (t: add 1 mana)
- considering: Priests of Norn (1/4 vig) -- vigilance is nice to attack safely :)
- Corrupted Conscience 3UU -- Control enchanted creature, it gain infect
- Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon (as a finisher?)

Equipment:
- Basilisk Collar (1, eq2): deathtouch and lifelink
- Whispersilk Cloak (3, eq2): unblockable, shroud
- Explorer's Scope (1, eq1): when attack, look at top card of lib, if land: put into play tapped
- Sylvok Lifestaff (1, eq1): eq gets +1/0; when eq creat it put to graveyard, u gain 3 life
- Adventuring Gear (1, eq1): Landfall: eqp creats gets +2/+2
- Strider Harness (3, eq1): Eq creats gets +1/+1 and haste
- Hammer of Ruin (SB 2, eq2) : gets +2/0 and when dealt combat damage, u may destroy tgt equipment

Still considering G:
- Rot Wolf (2/2 for 2G w/: when a creat dealt damage by it is put to the graveyard, u may draw a card)
- Tangle Angler (1/5 for 3G w/: G: tgt creat must block him if able) + Infiltration Lens
