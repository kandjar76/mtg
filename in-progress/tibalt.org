Wow Demigod is really strong!!!!
The current version lack a bit of land.
Also: Grave Scrabbler should leave. I did have it couple of times... and haven't use his Madness ability a single time.

Not too convinced by either Recoup or Buried Alive.

Failed!
Having Tibalt out on turn 2 and not using his ability the entire game -> Fail!

v0.1 -> v0.2:

-2 Call to the Netherworld

-1 Big Game Hunter
-2 Hellspark Elemental

+2 Fiery Temper
-4 Mountain
+2 Raging Ravine
+2 Forest

Version 0.1:
------------
I think the deck has some potentials...
Pyroclasm is a great cards... 4-of seems more appropriate
Faithless Loting does work really well w/ madness...
