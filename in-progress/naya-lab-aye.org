---------------
Sideboard update:
-2 Gruul Charm
+2 Mizzium Mortar


v0.5 -> v5.1:
-------------
   I'm not convinced by Assemble the Legion...
   Going to try the gruul charm as it will get rid of swarm of spirits :) And also hits Olivia and other flying vampire (Nighthawk)
-2 Assemble the legion
+2 Gruul Charm

v0.4 -> v0.5:
--------------
Mainboard:

   Going to try Thundermaw over Aurelia, 1 more toughness and 1 less mana to cast it.
-2 Aurelia, the War Leader
+2 Thundermaw Hellkite

   Reverting the option back to what it was.. I like the option to deal with planeswalkers.
-2 Selesnya Charm
+2 Boros Charm

   I like Zealous, but he's now always useful; I feel I should still have one in the side potentially
-2 Zealous Conscript
+1 Bonfire of the Damned
+1 Dryad Militant

Sideboard changes:

   I'd like to try Ruric against control, if he lands, it could be very difficult to get rid of him
+2 Ruric Thar, the Unbowed
-1 Boros Charm
-1 Ground Seal


Version 0.4: 
------------
Very pleased with Bonfire already.
Should consider increasing the count to 3 MB.

Boros is also great to take care of planeswalkers.


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-2 Ghor-Clam
+2 Bonfire of the Damned

Version 0.3:
------------
I really like Dryad Militant; she does put a nice pressure on the opponent at a very cheap cost + hose snapcaster.
Ghor-Clam has been a wash.
Not convinced by Aurelia... Her 4 toughness put her at great risk...
Still unsure about the choice of Charm mainboard.

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
Mainboard updates: 

   I'd like to try a more aggressive version, less dependent on the mana ramp.
-4 Avacyn's Pilgrim
+3 Dryad Militant 
-3 Restoration Angel 
+2 Ghor-Clam Rampager
+2 Aurelia, the War Leader

   This land could be great either late games or when u create tokens
+2 Slayer's Stronghold
-1 Rootborn Craig
-1 Cliftop Retreat

   I want to try more selesnya main board -- I didn't use Boros charm that much.
+2 Selesnya Charm
-2 Boros Charm

Sideboard changes:
-2 Selesnya Charm
+2 Boros Charm

-3 Purify the Grave
+3 Ground Seal

-2 Sigarda, Host of Herons
+2 Sundering Growth

-2 Searing Spears
+2 Assemble the Legion


Version v0.2:
-------------
Deck is fun!!!
The sideboard clearly needs some works
One of the deck main weakness so far: the reanimator decks...

After initial playtesting:
+++ Voice of resurgence is insanely good!
+   Advent of the Wurm is OK, especially after populate BUT currently the deck depends too much on him to win... 
+++ Huntmaster is awesome! Especially in combinaison with with Voice of Resurgence :)
-   Restoration Angel isn't so useful here...
++  Boros Reckoner is really good to block early aggression
+++ Zealous Conscript is AWESOME! Always need to steal a threat OR a planeswalker.. -- Sadly, It doesn't kill the threat.. 
~   Avacyn's Pilgrim is a '???' type of cards, it does help BUT at the same time can hurt if u really on him and it gets killed.

++  Garruk Relentless has been really good; being able to kill 3 toughness creature is a real bonus here -- The creature tutoring ab has also been really really good.
++  Pillar of Flame is your best friends against Zombie OR Voice of Resurgence
+++ Warleader's Helix has save my butt so many times... A MUST!
+   Boros Charm is neat... But I need to try it a bit more...
++  Rootborn Defense does wonders; the deck has enough tokens to populate to turn any kill attempt into a backfired trick :)
