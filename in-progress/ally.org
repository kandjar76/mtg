Current consideration:
   in the main deck: should I add a third Leyline of Anticipation...
   have to try to play with Contagious Engine in the main deck to see if it's playable.
   if note: I'll swap it for "Rite of Replication".

Elspeth Tirel is definitively a strong planeswalker.
I would probably switch her with Venser, the Sojourner; however she turned out useful in many games.
The mana changes (removing 3 plains to add more dual color land) didn't seem to be to problematic.

Change in the main deck:
 - usually "Mana Leak" is only useful to counter a artifact or enchantment; creatures aren't too much of an issue;
besides, there is always "Days of Judgement", so instead of "Mana Leak", I put: 2 "Revoke Existence".

Sideboard wise:
- summoning trap isn't so much useful here; the most likely spell which are gonna get countered are:
   the planeswalkers, the days of judgement spells, potentially mimic vat... but rarely the ally I 
   think. -> removed! adding Contagious Clasp instead

Sideboard usage:

  Against Mill, Sacrifice, Direct Damage Red:
  -1 Day of Judgement
  -2 Revoke Existence
  +3 Leyline of Sanctity

  Against Totem Armor; Eldrazi Monumnet; or Basilisk Collar:
  +2 Revoke Existence

  Against artifact heavy/dangerous deck:
  -1 Plain
  +1 Mountain
  +3 Tuktuk Scrapper
  -3 ???

  Against instructible artifact: 
  -1 or -2 Day of Judgement and +2 Revoke Existence
