Also to consider:
 4 CMC creat which tap to put a creat to play
 creature you put into play if you get attacked
 trap card?

 considering blue:
 - to return mossword to hand after using its ability
 - to use: Retraced Image (U sorc -> reveal card from ur hand put it into play if has same name as another card in play)
 - white hideway also to consider.
 - Aetherplasm 

 -> Going green blue seems a nice way to go!!

 Note: why having so many eldrazi dudes!!!
 I won't be able to cast them the hard way.
 -> I need to be able to place some on top of the library (Wordly tutor, brainstorm)
 -> Need to be able to put some back to the lib (brainstorm, compulsive research)
 -> Need to be able to cast them from the lib (Polymorph, Defense of the Heart, Proteus Staff)
 -> Protection: counter spell
 -> Spawn Tokens!! to sacr them!

 Current version:
 36 spells + 24 land
 
 Considering adding black for cards such as: Sacrifice ($.25) or maybe: Metamorphosis ($.3) for G but as a sorcery
