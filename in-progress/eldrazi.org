Also to consider:
 4 CMC creat which tap to put a creat to play
 creature you put into play if you get attacked
 trap card?

 considering blue:
 - to return mossword to hand after using its ability
 - to use: Retraced Image (U sorc -> reveal card from ur hand put it into play if has same name as another card in play)
 - white hideway also to consider.
 - Aetherplasm 

 -> Going green blue seems a nice way to go!!
