Version 1.1:
------------
After some playtesting, quite fun and versatile.
However, no chance to win agaisnt fast infect -- it its current state.
Also: I think the mana needs some tuning.

On the positive side: vat + pod => awesome!!! :)
For v1.2, gonna try 1 more Vat (probably -1 GSZ)




Comment v0.1:
-------------
Forbidden Alchemy -> not so good.
Doesn't really suit the style for this deck.
Also: more 3 CMC creatures.
=> -2 Forbidden Alchemy
