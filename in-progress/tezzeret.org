Comment about v1.8:
  Sword played such a big role in these games..
  As well as the main 3 creatures: obli, skirge and metamorph.
  Didn't see many tezz...
  Couldn't replace Wurmcoil in time.
  It definively doesn't fit the deck!
  -> -2 Wurmcoil +1 Batterskull, +1 Sword of F&F.

07/09/11: FNM
  Finish 2nd, great night!
  Match 1: 2-0, played against a mono white knight deck.
    Obliterator and Vault skirge, both played a big role for the victory.
    Obliterator made him stops the attack, while vault skirge was damaging him through the air.
    Doom blade on the flying knights.. 

  Match 2: 2-0 Red Kuldotha
    Game1: 
     IoK -> The goblin lord.
     Skirge / metamorph the skirge... Trying to minimize the life loss..
     I was in surviving mode..
     Until I drew Sword of War and Peace.
     He killed a skirge, I played a second metamorph to make another one.
     And I kept attacking with 1 eqp w/ the sword, then attach the sword to the other one to defend.
    Game 2: 
     Skirge turn 1 / killed...
     Survival mode again...
     Obliterator on turn 4, froze him a bit.
     Turn 5: tezz -> +1 -> metamorph
     Turn 6: play skirge, turned him into a 5/5, play metamorph copying the obliterator.
     Game locked.

  Match 3: 2-0 against grand architect
    Game 1:
     First game was slow... Played 3 skirge and an obliterator.
     He pinned my obli down with 2 different tumble magnet...
     Then use mystic maze to keep him out of combat.
     I then drew a sword to finish him
    Gane 2:
     Duress.
     Obliterator turn 4
     Play skirge, sword of B&M
     Next: tezz -> skirge -> 5/5 -> equip
     He then played a Platinum Emperion
     doom blade, he's tapped out,
     Turn spellskite into a 5/5, swing with everything for his last 14 damage.

  Match 4: 2-0 Against RUW Exarch Twin.
    Game 1: 
     IoK -> wall of omen (he had 2 spreading seas, no blue mana)
     I saw the sun titan; he played it a 6 mana... return WoO to play.
     I play phyrexian metamorh copying the titan, then doom bladed it.
     Drew 2 swords, equip the titan. Win.
   Game 2: SBed in: 2 spelskite, and 2 hex paradise.
     Turn 1: IoK, made him discard into the roil, noticed a DoJ.
     Played spellskite, sitting on my mana with a Gfft in hand.
     Played very cautiously.
     He DoJ; played the second one.
     Play Gideon force the attack,
     Using tar pit I managed to get him down to 2.
     He killed spellskite, killing his gideon to play another one.
     Played batterskull; he kept forcing the attack on gideon.
     Played another spellskite equipped him with batterskull.
     Vigilance was the key.
     Finished him with the sword of B&M.

  Match 5: 2-0 against UB control.
    Game 1:
      Played it cautiously, he duress me couple of time knew what I had in my hand.
      So I played what appeared to be the least threatenin; Sword of W&P (had F&F in hand + obli)
      He didn't countered it.  I kept attacking him little by little until the game was too big, he scooped.
    Game 2:
      I managed to an obliterator out.  And protect him with spellskite (against dismember)
      Game ended quickly.

  Match 6: Final / lost 0-2 against aggro vamps.
    Game 1: 
      Didn't have much of a hand; should have mull.
      Didn't draw anything very good .
      Were able to play an obliterator, but got forced to sacrifice it.
      Got finished with two lightning bolts.
    Game 2:
      Bad draw again, down to 5 cards.
      Kept: 1 obli, 1 Phyrexian and 3 lands.
      Drew 2 Phyrexian in a row.
      Got my 4 mana too late..
      Tried to copyed my opponents creatures...
      But too many kill spells..
      I resisted for a long time; and I only I had 1 more mana... 
      I drew a sword of W&P but couldn't play and equp it at the same time.. 
      Can't say I was very lucky in this last round.


Comment about v1.7:
- The deck played really well when I'm not stupid.. :)
- However, clearly lacking of artifacts.
- Also: I ended up sideboarding the ponder spells...
  So Instead, I'm gonna replace them with 3 more artifacts.
- Finally: I again didn't play wurmcoil engine... The 6 CMC is too much.
  => I'm gonna replace it with 2 Batterskulls.


07/07/11: Second tournament of the deck:
  Match 1: Against basic infect deck
    Lost 1/2
    Game 1: Lost. he had an awesome starting hand, mine was so-so, didn't improve...
    Game 2: Won. Ok game, I was dominating the whole game because of hte removal
    Game 3: Lost. Terrible draw for me... Drew 9 lands in a row...
    Again, in this round, I did a MAJOR mistake: not sideboarding in the 2 other spellskite.
    He was playing beefed up infect deck... Spellskite is a big threat.
  Match 2: Agaist Red Deck.
    Won 2/0.
    Game 1: He mull to 5, and did't do much.
    Game 2: I pulled vault skirge, made it a 5/5 with tezz, had the obliterator out. 
      I was gaining so much life, and doing so much daage. It was over.
  Match 3: another infect.
    Won 2/0
    Game 1: Obliterator and kill spell were the keys.
    Game 2: SB spellskite in.
      I duressed him couple of times; he sideboarded some artifact destruction.
      I made copy of my spell skite with metamorph. Obliterator out. Game over.
  Match 4: Again hexarch twin
    Lost 2/1
    Game 1: Starting with 2 mana; didn't the third mana before turn 4 or 5; took another 3 turns to draw the 4th one...
      (bad) luck of the draw
    Game 2: SB in: torpor orb, spellskite, gftt.
      He scoop after I played the second spellskite and the orb.
      Obliterator was out.
    Game 3: I lost coz I'm studid.
      I use the wrong kill spell TWICE!
      Had all 3 different kill spell in my hand, and surgical extraction.
      I kill a stupid artifact with dismember instead of using doom blade.
      I kill the Deceiver Exarch with doom blade (then exile each copy from the game) keeping gfft 
      with Myr Galvanizer out... 

07/02/11: The deck saw its first FNM
  Overall -> really liked it!!
  Fun deck to play with!

  Match 1: Against mono black w/ the obliterator.
    Won 2/0.
    Game 1: the key of that game was vault skirge equipped with SoF&F.
    Game 2:
      He started by bringing out two lashwrite. 
      After he casted the second one, I played the obliterator which stall the game for him
      The skirge + tezz won me the game again :)
  Match 2: Against Valakut Ramp.
    Lost 2/0
    Game 1: Duress its "explore", but on turn 4 he played "oracle of mul daya"
      No removal, and drew only lands from that point...
    Game 2: His starting hand was 2 titans, the oracle, and 3 lands...
      I kill the oracle asap.
      However he was stil able to lay down two lands.
      Turn 5 he play its first titan
      Played the tumble magnet; 
      Turn 6, he played its second titan, fetch for 2 valakut.
      I cracked the tec edge; and surgical extraction on the valakut in the graveyard.
      Next turn, I played the obliterator so with tumble magnet, I was thinking: I can keep the titans in check.
      However, turn 7, he drew avenger of zendikar.
      I drew a land on turn 8 and conceided.
      I was one card away from ratchet bomb.
      
      My major mistake: the SB; 
      I sideboarded out Phyrexian Metamorph without thinking... 
      I would have had it (I had in my hand the card I originally wanted to SB and then decided to SB the metamorph....)

  Match 3: I played against a GW ramp/control... 
     Won 2/1
     Weird but somewhat interesting deck.
     Running 3 Primeval Titan, 3 Baneslayer, 6 planeswalker... Garuk, adjani... 
     A bunch of mana acceleration (llanowar elves, bop...)
     Also: Emrakul, and 3 or 4 Genesis waves.
   Game 1:
     He played very quickly the angel, I dismembered her then casted surgical extraction on it...
     Vault skirge into 5/5 was the key to this game.
   Game 2:
     Elf -> Garruk -> Titan on turn 4
     He casted the titan, I metamorphed it.
     I killed garruk asap using the vault skirge (as a 1/1) and hex parasite..
     He casted genesis wave to grave a wurmcoil and another titan...
     Next turn, he casted another genesis wave... This time to get 2 other wurm coil...
     Game was over by then.
     Didn't drew anything good...
   Game 3:
     Really fast, obliterator + vaul skirge turned into a 5/5 ...
     Last round he casted the angel, but had only 3 life left, creeping tarpit was the finisher.

  Match 4:
     Tempered steel deck with golems...
     Lost 2/0
   Game 1: 
     I played it way too cautiosly thinking he was DoJ... 
     That caused me the game...
   Game 2:
     Awesome starting hand: 3 mana, 2 duress, 1 dismember and 1 phyrexian obliterator...
     And didn't drew a single mana for the rest of the game (10+ round)...
     But drew all my 4 casting cost cards.... 
     One sided game...
