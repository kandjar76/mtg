Initial version report:

 - either it works really well, or it doesn't work and stall stupidly.
 End result: not fun either way!
 - Missing: draws!!!

Second version worked better; still far from being fast enough though.
	       No doubt, the deck needs a second color.

Deck modified:
 - infiltration lens: doesn't seem to work
 - linewire lash: not enough spell to make it worth it!
   -> replaced by Sword of Vengence (concern: will I have enough mana?)

* Green version:

 - G -> Putrefax + mana acceleration (lotus cobra???)

Idea: using mana acceleration to speed up the deck and kill as fast as possible.
Concern: not drawing could be a major issue here... If I don't have teh right card in hand; it won't work.
If Mimic Vat can imprint Putrefax; it's almost guaranteed to be over.
