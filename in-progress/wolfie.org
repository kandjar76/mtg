v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-2 Garruk Relentless
+2 Green Sun's Zenith

Green Sun's Zenith has been a very helpful card in the playtest I did.
Overall: better than Garruk

Toward Verion 0.6:
------------------
I'd also like to try: 
-2 Garruk 
+2 Green Sun's Zenith
or
+2 Beast Within
But I think Overall: I want 2 Domri in this deck.

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-2 Incinerate
+1 Lightning Bolt
+1 Magma Jet

v0.3 -> v0.4
------------
-4 Wolfbitten Captive
-1 Mondronen Shaman
+3 Gatstaf Shepherd 
+2 Immerwolf
+1 Kruin Outlaw
-1 Instigator Gang

Version 0.3:
------------
The scry2 ability provided by magma set is a huge help!
I'm actually wondering if I should not increase the count ot it.

Some artifacts:
- Engineered Explosives
- Ratchet Bomb
Are brutal against this deck... :(
I'm wondering the best way to stop those... (and if any are maindeckable...)

Answer: 
- Null Rod       [Not modern legal -- And soo specific that it shouldn't be mainboarded...]
- Pithing Needle [Maybe... Considering that it could stall a planeswalker too...]

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Incinerate
-1 Lightning Bolt
+2 Magma Jet


Version v0.2:
-------------
A lot more fun!
Another card I just found and may be considered: Magma Set


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
Moonmist is a must! Need 4-of!

Changes:

-4 Forest
-4 Mountain
+4 Copperline Gorge
+4 Rootbound Crag 

+1 Full Moon's Rise
+1 Moonmist
-1 Immerwolf
-1 Deranged Outcast

-3 Immerwolf
-4 Brimstone Valley
+4 Lightning Bolt
+3 Incinerate

To try:
-1 Kruin Outlaw
+1 Moondronen Shaman



After inital try-out:
---------------------
Deck seems to have something to it.
Not quite fun yet... but not bad enough to just toss it out.
