Note: due to the nature of the fetch lands; I could put 1 swamp or 1 island and 1 spell using it: (in the sideboard that mean)
 - Comsuming Vapors (3B - sorc / tgt player sacrifice a land -- rebound)
 - Aether Tradewinds (2B - inst / return tgt perm u control and tgt perm u dont control to controller's hand)
 - spell pierce (B - inst: counter tgt non creat spell unless its controller pay 2)

Note: Hyena Umbra + Turntimber Basilisk -> WOW!!!
