v1.0 -> v1.01:
--------------
Sideboard:
-2 Echoing Truth
+2 Cavern of Soul

Toward 1.01 or 1.1:
-------------------
I really like the idea to put 2 Cavern of Soul in the sideboard.
I'd also like to increase the Leyline in the sideboard to 3.

Changes in Consideration:

Mainboard:
-3 Izzet Charm (?)
+3 Explore / Farseek (?)

Sideboard:
-1 Ancient Grudge
-2 Krosan Grip
-2 Echoing Truth
+2 Cavern of Soul
+2 Spellskite (?)

v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
Mainboard:
-1 Realmwright
+1 Prismatic Omen
-2 Whipe Away
+2 Echoing Truth

Sideboard
+1 Inferno Titan
+2 Echoing Truth
-2 Mindbreak Trap
-1 Sowing Salt

v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-1 Izzet Charm
-1 Remand
+2 Cryptic Command

Toward v0.9:
------------
Considering removing 1 spell pierce for 1 more Wipe Away, this spell is SOOOOO good!
Sideboard wise, I'd like to add 1 or 2 Sudden Shock (against infect)
or even Echoing Truth

v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
Mainboard:
-4 Serum Visions
+4 Izzet Charm
-3 Dispell
+3 Spell Pierce

Sideboard redone.

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
+1 Primeval Titan
+4 Serum Visions
-2 Khalni Heart Expedition
-3 Think twice

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
Mainboard:
+2 Primeval Titan
+3 Think twice
-1 Realmwright
-4 Peer Through Depths

v0.4 -> v0.5:
------------
