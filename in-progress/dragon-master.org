v1.0 -> v1.1:
-------------
-1 Bladewin the Risen
-1 Flameblast Dragon
+2 Thundermaw Hellkite
-3 Magmaquake
+3 Bonfire of the Damned
-1 Dragonspeaker Shaman
+1 Urza's Incubator

Toward 1.1:
-----------
I'm considering removing both:
-1 Bladewin the Risen
-1 Flameblast Dragon
And add: 
+2 Thundermaw Hellkite

Also adding an extra Cavern or 2 would be nice
Finally: +1 Urza's Incubator and -1 Dragonspeaker is also an interresting option.


v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-4 Everflowing Chalice
+4 Rakdos Signet

Version 0.9:
------------
The deck is so much more consistent.
Urza's Incubator is very nice.
Definitively a good addision to the deck.
Deck remains vulnerable to control
-> Maybe 1 more cavern.
Not sure about Bladewing the Risen -- Definitively no more than 1.

Considering replacing of Chalice by Rakdos Signet.

v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-1 Crucible of Fire
-2 Mudbutton
+3 Urza's Incubator

-1 Archwing Dragon
-2 Dragon Whelp
+1 Balefire Dragon
+1 Bogardan Hellkite
+1 Kilnmouth Dragon

-1 Hoardsmelter
+1 Whispersilk Cloak

-1 Thunder Dragon
-1 Mordant Dragon
+1 Bladewin the Risen
+1 Flameblast Dragon

Toward v0.9:
------------
Some dragons to consider:
. Thundermaw Hellkite
. Bladewin the Risen (3BBRR - return a dragon to play...) 

Still considering green as a third color...
For:
. Karthus, Tyran of Jund
. Bloodmother

v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-3 Mountain
+2 Lavaclaw Reaches
+1 Cavern of Soul

Version v0.7:
-------------
Magmaquake is really nice.
The instant speed effect is really worth it.

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-3 Bonfire of the Damned
+3 Magmaquake

Towards v0.7:
-------------
The deck is mostly worried about swarming land creatures... and potentially planeswalkers.
Replacing Bonfire by Magmaquake seems a very interesting option.
No more Miracle drawbacks AND instant speed effeect.

The two downsides:
. it will hits the Dragonspeaker shaman... and potentially Sarkhan
. it doesn't touch flying creatures -> BUT the dragons should be able to take care of that.

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Captive Flame
+1 Crucible of Fire

v0.4 -> v0.5
------------
-1 Punishing Fire
-2 Pyroclasm
-2 Red Sun's Zenith
-1 Slagstorm
-4 Lightning Bolt
-11 Mountain
+4 Blood Crypt
+4 Dragonskull Summit
+3 Swamp


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
+4 Lightning Bolt
-1 Breath of Darigaaz
-1 Spitting Earth
-1 Ghostfire
-1 Seismic Strike

Version 0.3:
------------
Mmm... The deck is fun; but I think the killspell needs to be updated.
