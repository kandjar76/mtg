Note about 2.10:
----------------
I'm too often color screwed.
I need to bump the blue sources.


Playtest results of 2.10:
-------------------------
Played against Red Deck Win: 2/0 -- Dramatic Rescue was sooo good!! Amazing! Jace also helped a lot! Giving me time (absorbing damage).
Played against UR Control:   1/0 -- Jace turn 3 is fantastic! (farseek turn 2), later after trying to cheat a miracle out of his hand, opponent rage quit.
Played against BR Control:   2/0 -- Game 1: he ws completely mana screwed. Game2: dramatic rune was awesome :)
Played against UB Hearless:  1/0 -- Turn 2: heartless; Turn 3: I played geist -- He played the 6/6 demon -> Turn 4: I casted Selesnya Charm; he quits.
Played against BGR Control:  0/2 -- Too many mistakes on my sides... Oh well :)


v2.00 -> v2.10:
---------------
Mainboard:
-2 Rootborn Defense
+2 Dramatic Rescue

Sideboard:
-2 Detention Sphere
+2 Negate


Comments about v2.00:
---------------------
Playing first game aginat UR aggro was rough :)
However, gave me incents on the deck: I really like having a 4th Centaur Healer in these match-up.  
Jace may not be as efficient -- Something maybe to side out.


Playtest result of 2.00:
------------------------
Played against UR aggro: 1/2 -- Game 1 and 3 were mostly one side game for him; mull down to 5 and mana screwed... no answers drawn... happened :)


Toward v2.00:
-------------
Jace seems to be a very good option to add to the deck
Either main or side... 

Mainboard:
-2 Geist of Saint Traft
-2 Cyclonic Rift
+1 Azorius Charm
+3 Jace, Architect of Thought
-1 Supreme Verdict
+1 Terminus

Sideboard:
-2 Azorius Charm

-1 Centaur Healer
-1 Entreat the Angels
-1 Loxodon Smiter
+1 Tamiyo, the Moon Sage

Playtest result of 1.80:
------------------------
Played against BG Zombie: 1/0 -- He made a mistake which cost him the game... Sadly: w/ all the life gaining this deck has, I drew none!!!
Played against BG Zombie: 0/2 -- G1: Mana screwed, no life gainer drawn... :( -> loss -- G2: Same thing... Drew Thragtusk but that's it... no good helper sadly.
Played against RB Discard: 2/0 -- Interesting deck, lots of wrath effect.
Played against UW Control: 1/0 -- Fairly straight forward game :)
Played against WB Aggro: 1/0 -- Not much of a match up.
Played against RBW Graveyard: 1/0 -- Life gain/Geist, and Selesnya Charm were keys to this game
Played against BWgr Control: 0/2 -- Game 1: Close game, lost in the end... Game 2: not so close :)

v1.80:
------
Mainboard wise:
+1 Restoration Angel 
-1 Entreat the Angels
Sideboard:
-1 Restoration Angel 
+1 Entreat the Angels


v1.71 -> v1.72/1.80:
--------------------
Recently, I've rarely sideboarded in Sigarda...
Should I keep her? -- Need to try her a bit more.

I'm also thinking: -1 Entreat in the MB +1 in the SB.
Replacing the spell w/ Restoration Angel or Azorius Charm.



Playtest result of 1.71:
------------------------
Played against a fast BR aggro: 2/1 -- Won first game, lost second game (too much land) -- Game3: Azorius Charm gave me 11 life thanks for lifelink which put me out of reach.
Played against BRW graveborn:   1/0 -- Left after the first game... :(
Played against UWG Fog/Mill:    2/1 -- I feel I got a bit lucky there...  
Played against GWb Aggro:       2/1 -- Lost first game, having too much mana -- Won game 2 thankx to farseek and Geist (was mana screweed) -- Game 3: he was mana screwed, and Azorius Charm made him loose a turn.
Played against RWB Enchan/Lock: 1/0 -- Very long game, my opp had a very unique deck based on enchan including the one forcing me to pay X to attack for each ench he had + graveyard recursion.
Played against UWB Token..      1/0 -- Won first game then server crashed... :(
Played against R aggro.         3/2 -- Garruuk saved me big time in G3
Played against UW human         1/0 -- Left after the first game... Note: Thalia is obnoxious... :)


v1.70 -> v.171:
---------------
Sideboard:
-2 Sundering Growth
+2 Azorius Charm

Playtest result of 1.70:
------------------------
Played against BR aggro:       2/0 -- First games was close, second hand
Played against GBU control:    1/0 -- After a very long game and very good game :) -- Restoration Angel definitively a bonus here!!!  Azorius Charm was also really good (unsummon and cancel his draw)
Played against GWB token deck: 3/0 -- Interresting deck, not too competitive.
Played against BR vamp:        0/1 -- Game lasted 12 rounds... Drew 1 farseek, 1 azorius charm and 10 lands... (looking at lib: the next two cards were lands... :() -- Then he left b4 game 2 :(



Note for v1.71:
---------------
I'm starting to question the need for Sundering Growth.
So far, it feels like the SB should have:
-1 Restoration Angel
-1 Centaur Healer
-2 Sundering Growth

Should I consider running 1/2 Tamayo?

After tests: 
  - a 4th Restoration Angel is good against control
  - a 4th Centaur is great against aggro
But:
  I yet have to find a deck against I want ot board Sundering Growth  


Toward v1.70:
-------------
After thougths... Snapcaster isn't as critical anymore in this build.
Furthermore: doesn't combo well with "Rest In Peace" (granted I can SB-ing him out for RIP :))

I'd like a bigger threat:
-2 Snapcaster Mage
+2 Restoration Angel
Note that I'd like to add a third restoration angel to the deck...

Some readjustement:
-1 Rootborn Defense
+1 Cyclonic Rift

Note: Entreat the Angel loose some usefulness against UW control... Due to Detention Sphere.
(I don't think I want more than 2 in the deck)

As of now: there are two cards I'd like to increase their number in main board:
- Restoration Angel, I believe 3 is better than 2 :) -- Need some playtests
- Garruuk: The hand refill ability is awesome...

Sideboard needs some work:
Not usre if a 4th Centaur or a 3rd angel in the sideboard is the way to go...


v1.50 -> v1.60:
--------------
Aggro can be quite dangerous...
-> Centaur Healer will move from SB to MB, replacing Call of the Conclave
In this version: testing Azorius Charm
Call of the Conclave is too fragile against unsummoning...

-3 Call of the Conclave
+3 Centaur Healer


v1.40 -> v1.50:
---------------
-4 Quirion Druid
+1 Supreme Verdict
+3 ??? -> Call of the Conclave

For one: I noticed that the druid is one of the cards, I often remove when sideboarding...
Also: the lack of flyer is occasionaly a issue.

When playing, druid and farseek conflict a lot!
Replacing it with the Restoration Angel is a trial; but I m a bit concern about not having any earlier blocker... 
Loxodon Smiter may fit the spot more appropriately...

As an extra point: Supreme Verdict is actually really nice in this deck!
I usually have few creatures out...

Proposal for replacement of the other 3 druid:
+3 Restoration Angel     -- Workds nicely w/ Thragstuk, has flash... BUT cost 4!
+3 Loxodon Smitter       -- 4/4 for 3... Without 1 drop accell, it's going to turn 3 minimum which conflict with geist. SB seems more appropriate.
+3 Centaur Healer        -- Maybe.. The whole point of druid was also for early defense... It's 3 CMC BUT the 3 life will help immediatly
+3 Call of the Conclave  -- 3/3 for 2CMC... I wish it wasn't a sorcery :P -- Can block pro-white dude... Works w/ rootborn... Die to the "mono-color killer"
+3 Azorius Charm         -- Only delay... But can be good too :) At worst: it's a useless cantrip. [I think I'll keep that option for later]

Going to first try w/ Call of the Conclave.
[Note: I would also like to try with Restoration Angel]


Toward v1.4:
------------

After playtesting with v1.3:
- I feel that: detention sphere should be main board (at least 2 of them)
- Mizzium Skin could maybe be sideboarded.
- Rootborn Defense is actually a nice spell!
- Still unsure about pilgrim...
I need to add Supreme Verdict somewhere in the deck. 
I believe: 3 SB

Changes to SB:
-3 Centaur Healer
+3 Knigth of Glory 
[The main reason for Centaur was to survive against Zombie.  Knight of Glory could also be good against Olivia type of deck.]
-3 Detention Sphere
+3 Supreme Verdict 







v1.30 -> v1.31:
---------------
+1 Rest In Peace
-1 Sundering Growth


Toward 1.3:
-----------
-3 Judge's Familiar
+3 Avacyn's Pilgrim
-1 Mizzium Skin
+1 Cyclonic Rift
-1 Alchemist's Reguge
+1 Gavony Township

SB:
-1 Heroes' Reunion
-1 Loxodon Smiter
-1 Rest in Peace
+3 Centaur Healer
