v3.10 -> v3.11
--------------
-1 Supreme Verdict
+1 Terminus

If I play against aggro, an extra terminus may be better than an extra verdict.


v3.02 -> v3.10
--------------
-3 Centaur Healer
+3 Loxodon Smitter

The non-counterable, the 4 body, and the discard-to-play ability make him worth it to replace healer.


v3.01 -> v3.02
--------------
Sideboard:
-1 Jace, Memory Adept
+1 Curse of Echoes

Jace has been useful but I don't feel I want him most of the time.


v3.00 -> v3.01
--------------
Sideboard:
-1 Detention Sphere
+1 Jace, Memory Adept


v2.91 -> v3.00
--------------
Main board:
-1 Angel of Serenity
-1 Tamiyo
+1 Jace
+1 Garruk

Sideboard:
-2 Sigarda
-1 Entreat
+1 Tamiyo
+1 Supreme Verdict
+1 Oblivion Ring

v2.90 -> v2.91
--------------
In the sideboard:
-1 Terminus
+1 Detention Sphere


v2.80 -> v2.90:
---------------
The deck needed update when facing control.
Also: I needed a way to get rid of tokens, and some planeswalker
   -> Detention Sphere

Alchemist's Refuge reveals itself as Awesome!
7 mana for a uncounterable wrath as instant speed is a must! :D

Mainboard changes:
-2 Azorius Charm
-1 Faith's Shield
+3 Syncopate
-1 Selesnya Charm
-1 Entreat the Angel
+2 Detention Sphere
-1 Gavony Township
+1 Alchemist's Refuge

Sideboard:
-1 Nevermore
-3 Negate
+2 Dissipate
+1 Entreat the Angels
+1 Selesnya Charm


Update for v2.80:
-----------------
Mainboard changes:
-1 Cyclonic Rift
-2 Dramatic Rescue
+2 Feeling of Dread
+1 Supreme Verdict
-1 Cavern of Souls
+1 Alchemist's Refuge

Sideboard:
-1 Nevermore
+1 Ajani, Caller of the Pride


Initial result using v2.70:
---------------------------
A *slap* in the face... Litterally.
I faced a esper (BUW) control deck, and he won most of the games... 
Sorin + Lingering Souls.. Opposed too many chumpy for my creature to go through...
Life gain was fairly useless since as some point he had the whole game in control.

I'd like to try out: Feeling of Dread as well as Alchemist's Reguge


Update for v2.70:
-----------------
Mainboard change:
-1 Garruk Primal Hunter
-1 Selesnya Charm
+2 Tamiyo, the Moon Sage

Sideboard:
-2 Detention Sphere
-1 Redirect
+1 Ray of revelation
+1 Sundering growth
+1 Nevermore

I decided to try Tamiyo in the deck.

And regarding the sideboard: 
I'm still not convinced about Detention Sphere.
And I need to be able to destroy enchantments (hence: ray of revelation + sundering growth)
Nevermore is a addition only against Jund control and their Slaughter Game spell


v2.60 -> v2.61
--------------
-1 Redirect in the SB
+1 Planar Cleansing

New card to consider:
---------------------
a 1-of in the sideboard of Planar Cleansing
Redirect isn't as good as I thought... :( Can't redirect: Rakdos Return or the 'new' Memoricide... neither duress... 
Basically, only good against: Brimstone Valey, kill spells... or Bonfire... -> Not great!
 -- I guess redirect can redirect the Auras...

Changes for v2.60:
------------------
I am not convinced with New Prahv...
As good as he his... He doesn't really help me early game.

Couple of options:
- an extra wrath (Terminus? Supreme Verdict?)
- an extra Restoration Angel?
- Sigarda?
- Mizsium or Rootborn defense?
- Faith's Shield?
- Snapcaster?

I like the idea of Faith's Shield... Could give some nice surprise...

Note: Got a guy who rage quit after seeing me protecting Jace with it against his pillar of flame :)
So far, I love this card... A great way to feel more secure at low-life, or to protect Jace for one more turn.


v2.40 -> v2.50:
--------------
I found geist to be a burden against aggro decks -- which are very common.
On the other hand: Entreat the Angeal can be a 2-turn game win if not answered.

Main board:
-2 Geist of Saint Traft
+2 Entreat the Angel

On the other hand, Geist is really strong against control.
And I have yet to board Tamiyo in... Easy replacement.
Also: Detention Sphere is good for removing some board threats... maybe better than Rift

Sideboard:
+1 Geist
+2 Detention Sphere
-2 Cyclonic Rift
-1 Tamiyo


v2.30 -> v2.40
--------------
Main Board: 
-1 Azorius Charm
-1 Gavony Township
+1 Cavern of Soul
+1 New Prahv Guildmage

It feels like 3 Azorius Charm is a bit much, this card turn out to be mostly a cantrip against many decks.
Trying a 1-of New Prahv Guildmage to see.
Also: 3 township seems overkill, 1-of Cavern is in study... When casting teh Angel of Serenity, I really want to guarantee its resolution.

SB:
-2 Loxodon Smiter
+1 Negate
+1 Redirect

The reason behind it: I was not playing Loxodon for its 4/4 stats, rather against Rakdos Return.
At the end of the day: feels very limited.

Whereas Negate has been good against control matchup.
I'm still debating about running 4 Negates in the side...

I'm going to try Redirect as a 1-of mostly against Red and Black deck:
- Redirecting Rakdos, Bonfire, other dispells or direct damage spells is awesome.
(+ can redirect also: Abrupt Decay :))


Playtest results of 2.30:
-------------------------
Played against BR Control: 1/1


Version 2.30:
-------------
-1 Forest
+1 Island

To have one of each basic land.


Note about 2.20:
----------------
Jace and Dramatic Rescue have been such great addition to the deck.
It's quite amazing.

Current SB options:
- Against aggro:
  +2 Terminus
- Against Control:
  +3 Geist / Sigarda
  +1 Tamiyo
  +2 Negate
- Against Zombie:
  +2 Rest In Peace
  +2 Terminus
- Against RB Control:
  +2 Loxodon Smitter
  +2 Terminus
- Against Token/Spirit:
  +2 Cyclonic Rift


Playtest results of 2.20:
-------------------------
Played agaisnt UW humans:  1/1 -- Game 1: horrible draws -- no help. Game 2: had the hwole game in control, he gave up after some times.
Played against UWG humans: 1/1 -- Game 1: I survived as long as I could, didn't get mana fast enough, and no wrath :( -- Game 2: the addition of extra wrath help a lot!
Played against UW humans:  1/0 -- Much better deck ironically but this time I also had decent had.
Played against BG Zombie:  1/0 -- Ramp + Garruuk were keys in this game -- I was able to draw 4 cards including: Angel of Serenity.
Played against 4C Control: 2/0 -- Game2: Negate and Geist didn't left him with a lot of choices.
Played against BUG Combo:  1/0 -- Interesting combo deck.  However, he didn't put me at risk a single time.  Then Garruuk -3 lead me to victory.
Played against WGB Ramp:   1/0 -- Jace was clearly the keys!!! Although: his Thragstuk was annoying! :) -- I did made mistake playing Selesnya Charm as 2/2 knights... Intead of waiting for exiling his creatures. 
Played against WG Ramp:    2/1 -- Game 3: kept a land w/ 2 mana... Could have been a mistake.. Big time mana screwed... But won in the end.



Note about 2.10:
----------------
I'm too often color screwed.
I need to bump the blue sources.
-1 Sunpetal Grove
-1 Forest
-1 Plain
+3 Glacial Fortress

Aside that: very very pleased with Negate!!



Playtest results of 2.10:
-------------------------
Played against Red Deck Win:  2/0 -- Dramatic Rescue was sooo good!! Amazing! Jace also helped a lot! Giving me time (absorbing damage).
Played against UR Control:    1/0 -- Jace turn 3 is fantastic! (farseek turn 2), later after trying to cheat a miracle out of his hand, opponent rage quit.
Played against BR Control:    2/0 -- Game 1: he ws completely mana screwed. Game2: dramatic rune was awesome :)
Played against UB Hearless:   1/0 -- Turn 2: heartless; Turn 3: I played geist -- He played the 6/6 demon -> Turn 4: I casted Selesnya Charm; he quits.
Played against BGR Control:   0/2 -- Too many mistakes on my sides... Oh well :)
Played against Bant Midrange: 1/0 -- Long game. 
Played against UWB Tokens:    1/0 -- Almost dies... but Jace, Garruuk and Thragtusk saved me.


v2.00 -> v2.10:
---------------
Mainboard:
-2 Rootborn Defense
+2 Dramatic Rescue

Sideboard:
-2 Detention Sphere
+2 Negate


Comments about v2.00:
---------------------
Playing first game aginat UR aggro was rough :)
However, gave me incents on the deck: I really like having a 4th Centaur Healer in these match-up.  
Jace may not be as efficient -- Something maybe to side out.


Playtest result of 2.00:
------------------------
Played against UR aggro: 1/2 -- Game 1 and 3 were mostly one side game for him; mull down to 5 and mana screwed... no answers drawn... happened :)


Toward v2.00:
-------------
Jace seems to be a very good option to add to the deck
Either main or side... 

Mainboard:
-2 Geist of Saint Traft
-2 Cyclonic Rift
+1 Azorius Charm
+3 Jace, Architect of Thought
-1 Supreme Verdict
+1 Terminus

Sideboard:
-2 Azorius Charm
+2 Geist of Saint Traft
+2 Cyclonic Rift
-1 Centaur Healer
-1 Entreat the Angels
-1 Loxodon Smiter
+1 Tamiyo, the Moon Sage

Playtest result of 1.80:
------------------------
Played against BG Zombie: 1/0 -- He made a mistake which cost him the game... Sadly: w/ all the life gaining this deck has, I drew none!!!
Played against BG Zombie: 0/2 -- G1: Mana screwed, no life gainer drawn... :( -> loss -- G2: Same thing... Drew Thragtusk but that's it... no good helper sadly.
Played against RB Discard: 2/0 -- Interesting deck, lots of wrath effect.
Played against UW Control: 1/0 -- Fairly straight forward game :)
Played against WB Aggro: 1/0 -- Not much of a match up.
Played against RBW Graveyard: 1/0 -- Life gain/Geist, and Selesnya Charm were keys to this game
Played against BWgr Control: 0/2 -- Game 1: Close game, lost in the end... Game 2: not so close :)

v1.80:
------
Mainboard wise:
+1 Restoration Angel 
-1 Entreat the Angels
Sideboard:
-1 Restoration Angel 
+1 Entreat the Angels


v1.71 -> v1.72/1.80:
--------------------
Recently, I've rarely sideboarded in Sigarda...
Should I keep her? -- Need to try her a bit more.

I'm also thinking: -1 Entreat in the MB +1 in the SB.
Replacing the spell w/ Restoration Angel or Azorius Charm.



Playtest result of 1.71:
------------------------
Played against a fast BR aggro: 2/1 -- Won first game, lost second game (too much land) -- Game3: Azorius Charm gave me 11 life thanks for lifelink which put me out of reach.
Played against BRW graveborn:   1/0 -- Left after the first game... :(
Played against UWG Fog/Mill:    2/1 -- I feel I got a bit lucky there...  
Played against GWb Aggro:       2/1 -- Lost first game, having too much mana -- Won game 2 thankx to farseek and Geist (was mana screweed) -- Game 3: he was mana screwed, and Azorius Charm made him loose a turn.
Played against RWB Enchan/Lock: 1/0 -- Very long game, my opp had a very unique deck based on enchan including the one forcing me to pay X to attack for each ench he had + graveyard recursion.
Played against UWB Token..      1/0 -- Won first game then server crashed... :(
Played against R aggro.         3/2 -- Garruuk saved me big time in G3
Played against UW human         1/0 -- Left after the first game... Note: Thalia is obnoxious... :)


v1.70 -> v.171:
---------------
Sideboard:
-2 Sundering Growth
+2 Azorius Charm

Playtest result of 1.70:
------------------------
Played against BR aggro:       2/0 -- First games was close, second hand
Played against GBU control:    1/0 -- After a very long game and very good game :) -- Restoration Angel definitively a bonus here!!!  Azorius Charm was also really good (unsummon and cancel his draw)
Played against GWB token deck: 3/0 -- Interresting deck, not too competitive.
Played against BR vamp:        0/1 -- Game lasted 12 rounds... Drew 1 farseek, 1 azorius charm and 10 lands... (looking at lib: the next two cards were lands... :() -- Then he left b4 game 2 :(



Note for v1.71:
---------------
I'm starting to question the need for Sundering Growth.
So far, it feels like the SB should have:
-1 Restoration Angel
-1 Centaur Healer
-2 Sundering Growth

Should I consider running 1/2 Tamayo?

After tests: 
  - a 4th Restoration Angel is good against control
  - a 4th Centaur is great against aggro
But:
  I yet have to find a deck against I want ot board Sundering Growth  


Toward v1.70:
-------------
After thougths... Snapcaster isn't as critical anymore in this build.
Furthermore: doesn't combo well with "Rest In Peace" (granted I can SB-ing him out for RIP :))

I'd like a bigger threat:
-2 Snapcaster Mage
+2 Restoration Angel
Note that I'd like to add a third restoration angel to the deck...

Some readjustement:
-1 Rootborn Defense
+1 Cyclonic Rift

Note: Entreat the Angel loose some usefulness against UW control... Due to Detention Sphere.
(I don't think I want more than 2 in the deck)

As of now: there are two cards I'd like to increase their number in main board:
- Restoration Angel, I believe 3 is better than 2 :) -- Need some playtests
- Garruuk: The hand refill ability is awesome...

Sideboard needs some work:
Not usre if a 4th Centaur or a 3rd angel in the sideboard is the way to go...


v1.50 -> v1.60:
--------------
Aggro can be quite dangerous...
-> Centaur Healer will move from SB to MB, replacing Call of the Conclave
In this version: testing Azorius Charm
Call of the Conclave is too fragile against unsummoning...

-3 Call of the Conclave
+3 Centaur Healer


v1.40 -> v1.50:
---------------
-4 Quirion Druid
+1 Supreme Verdict
+3 ??? -> Call of the Conclave

For one: I noticed that the druid is one of the cards, I often remove when sideboarding...
Also: the lack of flyer is occasionaly a issue.

When playing, druid and farseek conflict a lot!
Replacing it with the Restoration Angel is a trial; but I m a bit concern about not having any earlier blocker... 
Loxodon Smiter may fit the spot more appropriately...

As an extra point: Supreme Verdict is actually really nice in this deck!
I usually have few creatures out...

Proposal for replacement of the other 3 druid:
+3 Restoration Angel     -- Workds nicely w/ Thragstuk, has flash... BUT cost 4!
+3 Loxodon Smitter       -- 4/4 for 3... Without 1 drop accell, it's going to turn 3 minimum which conflict with geist. SB seems more appropriate.
+3 Centaur Healer        -- Maybe.. The whole point of druid was also for early defense... It's 3 CMC BUT the 3 life will help immediatly
+3 Call of the Conclave  -- 3/3 for 2CMC... I wish it wasn't a sorcery :P -- Can block pro-white dude... Works w/ rootborn... Die to the "mono-color killer"
+3 Azorius Charm         -- Only delay... But can be good too :) At worst: it's a useless cantrip. [I think I'll keep that option for later]

Going to first try w/ Call of the Conclave.
[Note: I would also like to try with Restoration Angel]


Toward v1.4:
------------

After playtesting with v1.3:
- I feel that: detention sphere should be main board (at least 2 of them)
- Mizzium Skin could maybe be sideboarded.
- Rootborn Defense is actually a nice spell!
- Still unsure about pilgrim...
I need to add Supreme Verdict somewhere in the deck. 
I believe: 3 SB

Changes to SB:
-3 Centaur Healer
+3 Knigth of Glory 
[The main reason for Centaur was to survive against Zombie.  Knight of Glory could also be good against Olivia type of deck.]
-3 Detention Sphere
+3 Supreme Verdict 







v1.30 -> v1.31:
---------------
+1 Rest In Peace
-1 Sundering Growth


Toward 1.3:
-----------
-3 Judge's Familiar
+3 Avacyn's Pilgrim
-1 Mizzium Skin
+1 Cyclonic Rift
-1 Alchemist's Reguge
+1 Gavony Township

SB:
-1 Heroes' Reunion
-1 Loxodon Smiter
-1 Rest in Peace
+3 Centaur Healer
