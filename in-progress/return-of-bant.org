v1.50 -> v1.60:
--------------
Aggro can be quite dangerous...
-> Centaur Healer will move from SB to MB, replacing Call of the Conclave
In this version: testing Azorius Charm
Call of the Conclave is too fragile against unsummoning...

-3 Call of the Conclave
+3 Centaur Healer


v1.40 -> v1.50:
---------------
-4 Quirion Druid
+1 Supreme Verdict
+3 ??? -> Call of the Conclave

For one: I noticed that the druid is one of the cards, I often remove when sideboarding...
Also: the lack of flyer is occasionaly a issue.

When playing, druid and farseek conflict a lot!
Replacing it with the Restoration Angel is a trial; but I m a bit concern about not having any earlier blocker... 
Loxodon Smiter may fit the spot more appropriately...

As an extra point: Supreme Verdict is actually really nice in this deck!
I usually have few creatures out...

Proposal for replacement of the other 3 druid:
+3 Restoration Angel     -- Workds nicely w/ Thragstuk, has flash... BUT cost 4!
+3 Loxodon Smitter       -- 4/4 for 3... Without 1 drop accell, it's going to turn 3 minimum which conflict with geist. SB seems more appropriate.
+3 Centaur Healer        -- Maybe.. The whole point of druid was also for early defense... It's 3 CMC BUT the 3 life will help immediatly
+3 Call of the Conclave  -- 3/3 for 2CMC... I wish it wasn't a sorcery :P -- Can block pro-white dude... Works w/ rootborn... Die to the "mono-color killer"
+3 Azorius Charm         -- Only delay... But can be good too :) At worst: it's a useless cantrip. [I think I'll keep that option for later]

Going to first try w/ Call of the Conclave.
[Note: I would also like to try with Restoration Angel]


Toward v1.4:
------------

After playtesting with v1.3:
- I feel that: detention sphere should be main board (at least 2 of them)
- Mizzium Skin could maybe be sideboarded.
- Rootborn Defense is actually a nice spell!
- Still unsure about pilgrim...
I need to add Supreme Verdict somewhere in the deck. 
I believe: 3 SB

Changes to SB:
-3 Centaur Healer
+3 Knigth of Glory 
[The main reason for Centaur was to survive against Zombie.  Knight of Glory could also be good against Olivia type of deck.]
-3 Detention Sphere
+3 Supreme Verdict 







v1.30 -> v1.31:
---------------
+1 Rest In Peace
-1 Sundering Growth


Toward 1.3:
-----------
-3 Judge's Familiar
+3 Avacyn's Pilgrim
-1 Mizzium Skin
+1 Cyclonic Rift
-1 Alchemist's Reguge
+1 Gavony Township

SB:
-1 Heroes' Reunion
-1 Loxodon Smiter
-1 Rest in Peace
+3 Centaur Healer
