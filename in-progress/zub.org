Version 1.2:

+2 Skirsdag High Priest
-1 Lili
-1 Island

Skirsdag has proven himself very very good!
Including against Red/Green decks.

I don't feel like BSZ should even be in the Sideboard.
Also, as much as the obliterator was nice to draw, drawing too many hurts.

Phantasmal Image has been awesome!!! Copying an undying creature is the best! :)
Considering upping the count.

Toward 1.1:

Even w/ 22 land it's feels like I was drawing too many lands..
Going down to 21 land for the next version

Phantasmal Image is great in this deck -> going up to 3 or 4 or him.

To help the draw, I wonder if the deck shouldn't run: ponder or Gitaxian Probe...

Flying is a big weakness right now -> Going to run 3 or 4 Corrosive Gate in the Side.
Vapor Snag could be an a good sideboard card too.
Potentially 2/3 Surgical Extraction against all undying guys.


Version 1.0:

Very fun fast paste aggro deck, however, the SB needs a lot of works.
So far, only sure points: RB.
