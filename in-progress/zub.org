Toward 1.1:

Even w/ 22 land it's feels like I was drawing too many lands..
Going down to 21 land for the next version

Phantasmal Image is great in this deck -> going up to 3 or 4 or him.

To help the draw, I wonder if the deck shouldn't run: ponder or Gitaxian Probe...

Flying is a big weakness right now -> Going to run 3 or 4 Corrosive Gate in the Side.
Vapor Snag could be an a good sideboard card too.
Potentially 2/3 Surgical Extraction against all undying guys.


Version 1.0:

Very fun fast paste aggro deck, however, the SB needs a lot of works.
So far, only sure points: RB.
