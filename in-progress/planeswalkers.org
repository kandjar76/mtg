Wondering if Tumble Magnet shouldn't be in the main deck!
At least 1! Potentially 2... But what to remove???

    +2 Leyline of Sanctity

    +2 Divine Offering
    +2 Leyline of Sanctity
    +1 Luminarch Ascension
  - UW Caw Blade:
    +2 Divine Offering
    +2 Ratchet Bomb
    +1 Baneslayer Angel
    +1 Sphinx of Jwar Isle
  - Infect:
    +2 Divine Offering
    +2 Tumble Magnet
    +1 Spreading Seas
    +1 Leyline of Sanctity
    +1 Sphinx of Jwar Isle
  - Vampire:
    +2 Leyline of Sanctity
    +1 Day of Judgement
  - Valakut Ramp:
    +2 Tumble Magnet
    +2 Flash Freeze
    +2 Leyline of Sanctity
    +1 Spreading Seas
  - Eldrazi Ramp:
    +2 Tumble Magnet
  - Boros:
    +1 Day of Judgement
  - Red ascension:
    +2 Leyline of Sanctity
  - Elves:
  - Battle cry:
    +1 Day of Judgement


Post FNM tournament:
  - Deck did OK; lost against two decks, mainly because of unlucky draws...
  - Spreading seas is really strong; against: infect, and valakut deck; but also against UB control 
    (taking care of their man land)
  - Elspeth more SB than MB planeswalker.
  - Gideon really really strong! Need one more of him!
  - Sun Titan should be SBed too.
  - The need of an instant speed artifact destruction is vital! (inkmoth infect land is a really pb :P)
  - I'm also considering SB one leyline of sanctity; and adding one more luminarch in the SB (against control and infect)
  - Lack of counters again! :P

Post gameday tournament:

  - Overall very happy!
  - Mana seems to work nicely.
    (a little bit vulnerable to tectonic edge... but overall good)
  - Played against 3 infect; 1 battlecry; 1 cow blade; 1 ramp deck.

  What to consider:
  - Felt a lack in term or counter
  - Sun Titan is more SB than MB.
  - Baneslayer was fun against Battlecry deck.
  - Frost Titan a lot stronger.
  Regarding the planeswalker:
  - Venser was fun, good; Elspeth wasn't good enough; too many flying creatures...
  - Gideon really strong again! -- Probably need one more!
  - Jace 2.0 is consider as a major threat; 
  - Where as: Jace 1.0 was left alone...
  Regarding the SB:
  - 1 more spreading seas in the SB could be good / or 3 in the main deck, 1 in the SB.
  - Fourth DoJ has been almost always added to the MB; it would have been appreciated to have extra Luminarch in the SB
  - Leyline of Sanctity -- Consider MBing one?
  - Each SB cards has been used during the games...

Post tournament results:

  - The deck played really well (minus some unlucky draws..)
  - Sadly, I didn't have the chance to play against other UW controls deck.
    Neither against infect deck.
  - A third Leyline in the SB is to consider.
  - I'm not sure if 3 Leonin Arbiter is that useful.  
    I guess the question being: what to remove to add this one instead.
  - Jace TMS, Gideon, Luminarch Ascension were key cards in this deck. 
  - Venser also played nicely!

  - On the to consider side:
    I haven't played the Sun Titan in the games; Considering replacing it by another Gideon.
    Bloodghast has been problematic.  Should I add Celestial Purge in the SB. 
  - Is Baneslayer useful in the SB???
    I like the first strike/lifelink aspect of it.
    However, since I have few creatures... Sphinx of Jwar Isle 
    .. however White creat is better than Blue one because of protection.

Note:
  Next step: taking the deck to a tournament.
  To solve 3 questions:
  - does the deck need more titans?
  - should the deck run Journey to Nowhere?
  - considering Baneslayer Angel in the SB -- to take Elspeth spot in a fight against UB control?
  So far the answers are:
    *Maybe* *Probably Not* and *Not likely*
  And finally: should I run 4 tectonic edge? (*very likely*)

  02/27/11: Coming back from a tournament with this deck,

  -> Jace the Mind Sculptor -- REALLY Strong in this deck!
  -> Gideon absolute key.
  -> Debating about the Sun Titan; I like that it bring back Jace Beleren but wasn't that useful.
  It may be better to replace him with another Gideon.
  -> Luminarch has been a key cards against many decks...
  Control or not; I can concentrate on slowing their deck down while luminarch is building up.
  -> Into the Roil -- So strong!!!

  Overall the deck did really well; hard to remove or add things... 
  I haven't cast the titan a single time during the games;
  It may still be a bit early to consider the deck to be *finished*... I haven't play many strong decks.

  Didn't feel the need for Journey to Nowhere.
  I'm gonna keep Baneslayer in the SB for now -- even if I didn't feel the need for it.


  Changes to consider: adding 1 more Gideon (removing: Sun titan?)
  Adding one more Jace TMS... (*sick* expensive)



  --

  Frost Titan and Sun Titan are two key cards in the deck!
    The main question is: should I put one more titan (most likely frost)
    But what should be removed in that case?
  Also: the deck only runs 22 mana! Removing a low csting cost to add
  a high casting cost cards could really impact the deck in a "non good" way!

  Would journey to nowhere be a descent addon to this deck? Not
  sure... Main question being: what would it replace?
