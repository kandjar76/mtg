This version of the deck seem to be working a lot better.
Creature weren't the main issue; rather than lack of discard ability.
Removing Mutilate seemed to have been a good choice so far, as well as having Geth's Grimoire.
I tried Phyrexian Arena, and I'm still not convince that Geth's grimoire is a lot better; but so far, so good; 
I'm gonna try to run this deck a couple more times and see what are its weaknesses.

Note: Pox is definitively a critical card in the deck; good and bad based on the timing it gets played.
Also: I'm not sure if Honden is the best card choice here.

Note: 

 The second revision of the deck didn't work really well.  The main issue being the lack of 
 winning factor.  I though the the quest and Nyxathid were the winning factor of this deck, 
 but it turns out that Nyxathid isn't a winning factor at all, it will however prevent my
 opponent from attacking me for a while... But it doesn't really do much else.
 The reason being: this creature as big as it is doesn't have invasion.  Therefore a small 0/1
 can block it, and I get wacked by the other ones. 
 Also, the lack of cards is a major issue, Dark Ritual is awesome, but it can take space for card
 I need a way to draw cards.

 As extra notes, Beseech the Queen is a good card, a way to search is definitively a good adding to the deck
 However, having to show the cards is a issue.

 Sygg by itself didn't help much, the opponents were focussing on me, and therefore I couldn't attack neither
 draw extra cards.
 
 The hypnotic specter is 100% great!
 Hymn to Tourach was also a great addon to this deck.
 
 I like Delirium Skein, however the penalty is very big, maybe because I don't draw extra cards.

 The third version of this deck should include: 
 - More creatures!
 - I wanna bring back: Strongarm Tactics
 - Megrim should definitively come back to this deck.
 - Phyrexian Arena should be added to it.
 - Need better way to kill creatures!  In order to protect myself. (some assassin?)

 Big Game Hunder requires big creature, it's better to have 4 Nightshade Assassin and 3 Big Game Hunder than 3 and 4
 In term of land, remove 4 swamp and add 4 Bojuka Bog (in case the opp is playing w/ his graveyard...)
 Remove of 1 mutilate and 1 Delirium skeins to add 2 pulling teeths, clash is nice, let me swithc the next card to draw if necessary

 Bloodhusk Ritualist -- useless!
 Cunning Lethemancer - GOOD!!!
 Dream Salvage - good early, useless after => 2 is good enough!!

 Either replacing Bloodhusk with 
 Also: Need a way to kill creatures!!!!!

 Mutilate: almost required! ($1 at trolland...)

 Finally: 20 lands seems a bit short!!!
 I will got for 22.
