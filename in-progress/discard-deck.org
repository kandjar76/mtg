Note:
 Big Game Hunder requires big creature, it's better to have 4 Nightshade Assassin and 3 Big Game Hunder than 3 and 4
 In term of land, remove 4 swamp and add 4 Bojuka Bog (in case the opp is playing w/ his graveyard...)
 Remove of 1 mutilate and 1 Delirium skeins to add 2 pulling teeths, clash is nice, let me swithc the next card to draw if necessary

 ---

 Bloodhusk Ritualist -- useless!
 Cunning Lethemancer - GOOD!!!
 Dream Salvage - good early, useless after => 2 is good enough!!

 Either replacing Bloodhusk with 
 Also: Need a way to kill creatures!!!!!

 Mutilate: almost required! ($1 at trolland...)

 Finally: 20 lands seems a bit short!!!
 I will got for 22.
