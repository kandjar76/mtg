Setup of the base line:
- Currently: 23 cards (+ 24 lands) => 17 open slots.
- Three colors UWG -> Should it be two?  Only U creatures is the predator.
- Still needs draws / mana boost / way to slow the game down.
- More instants!

Initial Playtesting Report:
---------------------------

Note: overall... failed.
The deck is clearly not balanced at all
When it gets the perfect hands -> awesome. 
Otherwise, the deck do a butt load of nothingness waiting for the round to be over.

Deck needs draws and/or way to generate tempo.
Considering how mana heavy the deck is: 24 lands seems a requirement.
