|----+---------------------------+-----+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Considering:
 - 1 or 2 Liliana Vess
 - 1? Skeletal Scrying (don't like the add cost of X cards to remove from graveyard)
 - 1 or 2 Raven's Crime (tgt player discard for B -- but has retrace!!! (discard land, play it again))

 - 1 or 2 Tectonite Edge (tap for 1 -- 1, t: destroy non basic land if its controller has at least 4 lands)

Multiplayer Player Version:
-3 The Rack
+1 Geth's Grimoire
+2 Honden of Night's Reach

Words of Waste (2B ench - 1: next time u draw this turn; each opp discard instead)


--------------------------------------------

Got wacked 3 games in a row by a black sacrifice STANDARD DECK!!!!!
I think "draw card" is missing in this deck!
  
  Night Wisper (1B -> sorc | Draw 2, and loose 2 life)
  Sign of Blood (BB -> sorc | Draw 2 and loose 2 life)

  Skeletal Scrying? (xB -> inst!! | Add cost: exile X card from graveyard -> draw X and loose X)
  Cruel Bargain (BBB -> sorc | Draw 4 and loose half life) AKA Infernal Contract

Looking at:

   Chains of Mephistopheles (SB) (prevent refilling hand too quickly) --> EEEK!!!! TOOO expensive!!!
   Underworld Dreams (BBB -> ench | Whenever opp draw, he looses 1 life)


Also:
  Need to consider winning condition / helper
  Are helpers useful if not in a winning condition state?

  For example: 
   Instant to give protection to a creature is useful only if there is a creature in play


 - maybe 1 death cloud? (xBBB - sorc - EACH play loose x life, sacr x creat, x land, discard x card)
