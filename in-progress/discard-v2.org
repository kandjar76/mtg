Got wacked 3 games in a row by a black sacrifice STANDARD DECK!!!!!
I think "draw card" is missing in this deck!
  
  Night Wisper (1B -> sorc | Draw 2, and loose 2 life)
  Sign of Blood (BB -> sorc | Draw 2 and loose 2 life)

  Skeletal Scrying? (xB -> inst!! | Add cost: exile X card from graveyard -> draw X and loose X)
  Cruel Bargain (BBB -> sorc | Draw 4 and loose half life) AKA Infernal Contract

Looking at:

   Chains of Mephistopheles (SB) (prevent refilling hand too quickly) --> EEEK!!!! TOOO expensive!!!
   Underworld Dreams (BBB -> ench | Whenever opp draw, he looses 1 life)


Also:
  Need to consider winning condition / helper
  Are helpers useful if not in a winning condition state?

  For example: 
   Instant to give protection to a creature is useful only if there is a creature in play

Deck modified. 
The list of cards is gonna get updated very soon.
May need other way to destory than pox:
  - problem with pox; if your opp has 2 creatures, one good, you can't get rid of it.

Alternated way:
 - damnation (2BB) or mutilate(2BB)
 - dianolic edict (1B - inst - tgt play sacr a creature)
 - maybe 1 death cloud? (xBBB - sorc - tgt play loose x life, sacr x creat, x land, discard x card)
 - innocent blood (B - sorc - each play sacr a creat)
 - comsuming vapors (3B - sorc - tgt play sacr a creat, u gain life eq to creats toughness - rebound)
