v0.32 -> v0.40:
---------------
-3 Deathrite Shaman
+3 Scavenging Ooze


Version v0.32:
--------------
I'm wondering if Scavenger Ooze would not be a better fit than Deathrite Shaman.
It doesn't deals life damage when removing a spell; but it target any cards.  And can do it multiple times a turn.
Tough choice.

Deathrite Shaman has two advantages over Scavenger Ooze:
- he's black and therefore cannot be targetted bu Doom Blade.
- he cost 1 and can be a good turn 1 drop

Scavenger Ooze has on the other hand its own benefits:
- Can be activated the turn you play it.
- Can become a serious threat as he will grow overtime.

Overall, the deck doesn't rely on turn 1 play.
I think it's better to try it out and see how it feels.


v0.31 -> v0.32:
---------------
-2 Oblivion Ring
-1 Liliana of the Veil
+1 Golgari Charm
+2 Tragic Slip


Version 0.31:
-------------
Golgari Charm is really nice in this deck.
On the other hand, O-Ring doesn't fit the build


v0.30 -> v0.31:
---------------
Sideboard:
-1 Liliana of the Veil
-1 Ray of Revelation
+2 Golgari Charm


v0.22 -> v0.30:
---------------
Mainboard:
-2 Liliana of the Veil
+1 Deathrite Shaman
+1 Putrefy

Sideboard:
-1 Deathrite Shaman
-1 Putrefy
+2 Liliana of the Veil


v0.21 -> v0.22:
---------------
Sideboard change:
+1 Obzedat, Ghost Council
-1 Blood Baron of Vizkopa


v0.20 -> v0.21:
---------------
Sideboard change:
-2 Vraska the Unseen
+2 Gaze of Granite


Version 0.20:
-------------
Well... I just face an elf decks... 
And boy it's really hard...
I think the deck needs some board sweep in the side...
Like: Gaze of Granite


v0.13 -> v0.20:
---------------
Mainboard:
-1 Abrupt Decay
+1 Putrefy

Sideboard:
-2 Devour Flesh
-1 Ray of Revelation
+1 Putrefy
+2 Oblivion Ring


Version v0.13:
--------------
One potential issue with this deck:
The deck cannot deal with black creature over 3CMC (aside from Lilina)

This include (but is not limited to):
- Blood Baron of Vizkopa: 
- Obzedat, Ghost Council
- Falkenrath Aristocrat
- Olivia Voldaren
- Sire of Insanity
- Vampire Nocturnus
(also:)
- Corpsejack Menace
- Bloodline Keeper
- Desecration Demon
- Griselbrand
- Master of Cruelties
- Mikaeus, the Unhallowed 
- Necropolis Regent
- Shadowborn Demon

The sideboard should be updated for it.
Option:
- Tragic Slip
- Oblivion Ring
- Putrefy
- Orzhov Charm (with potentially high cost)
- Plummet (for flying)
(Note: No easy way to take care of Blood Baron)


v0.12 -> v0.13:
---------------
-3 Sin Collector
+1 Lifebane Zombie
+2 Devour Flesh


Version v0.12:
--------------
I feel like I need more way to kill creatures.
Sin Collector in the sideboard double the use of Duress which overall is more versatile.


v0.11 -> v0.12:
---------------
Sideboard:
-1 Blood Baron of Vizkopa
+1 Deathrite Shaman


Version v0.11:
--------------
The deck works really well so far.
I'm still concern about Control match up.
Currently considering updating the sideboard...


v0.1 -> v0.11:
--------------
Sideboard:
-2 Ratchet Bomb
+2 Ray of Revelation
