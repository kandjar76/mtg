Deck ideas based on: opponent action -- He's the one 'in-control' :)
Still consider changing the name of the deck!


v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
+1 Lightning Storm
-1 Arnageddon Clock


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Swamp
+1 Mountain


Version v0.5:
-------------
Skullscorch is really fun, feels better than Vexing Devil.
Not quite sure about Armageddon Clock.


v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-4 Vexing Devil
+4 Skullscorch
-1 Desacration Demon
+1 Lava Blister
-1 Blazing Salvo
+1 Lava Blister


Version 0.4:
------------
Fun deck to play with..
Not enough play testing yet.
Found more cards, I'd like to try some of them


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-2 Land's Edge
-4 Nakaya Shade
+1 Rhystic Tutor
+1 Breaking Point 
+4 Blazing Salvo


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Desecration Demon
+1 Armageddon Clock


Version v0.2:
-------------
The deck is a lot of fun so far.
Going to Armageddon Clock.


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+1 Vexing Devil
+1 Land's Edge
+2 Mountain
-3 Carrion Rats
-1 Worms of the Earth


Version v0.1:
-------------
Carrion Rats doesn't interract very well with Oona's Prowler.
Also, Lightning Storm is really fun...  for which the deck needs more lands :)


Version v0.0:
-------------
Black/Red deck looks very fun for such decks.
It has threats and draws... I like it.
