Post tournament:
   Deck did really good :) => Finished 2nd.
   Venser is really strong in the deck -> +2
   Need to find room for a third leyline of anticipation...
   and also: tectonic edge (sac destruction land)
   And also now considering running the Contagious Engine instead of Clasp
    -> because of Venser and hara.
   
Sideboard update: Gonna replace Negate by Mindbreak again.
   -> It's still the best way to take care of Eldrazi dudes!!!
   
Previous consideration:
   Considering: -2 protection ally +2 flying bird ally.
   in the main deck: should I add a third Leyline of Anticipation...
   Wondering if I should not keep 5 plain (removing 1 Glacial Fortress)
   Also: considering putting 1 Tuktuk and 1 Mountain in the main deck.

Ratchet Bomb: really good against massive token.
Yes Day of Judgement take care of the problem; but Ratchet Bomb add an extra card for it
Furthermore: Sun Titan can fetch for it.!!!

Putting 4 of the leyline seems overkill for now; putting 4 means: 
 - removing 4 cards from the deck to just put this one! -> down to 3
Same for revoke; this leave room for an extra spell: Celestial Purge

Mindbreak Trap is way to high casting cost to be that useful.  Usually
I want to counter non creature spells.

Contagious Engine isn't good enough; it's strong, but too high casting cost.
Contagious Clasp is much better.

Elspeth Tirel is definitively a strong planeswalker.
I would probably switch her with Venser, the Sojourner; however she turned out useful in many games.
The mana changes (removing 3 plains to add more dual color land) didn't seem to be to problematic.

Change in the main deck:
 - usually "Mana Leak" is only useful to counter a artifact or enchantment; creatures aren't too much of an issue;
besides, there is always "Days of Judgement", so instead of "Mana Leak", I put: 2 "Revoke Existence".

Sideboard wise:
- summoning trap isn't so much useful here; the most likely spell which are gonna get countered are:
   the planeswalkers, the days of judgement spells, potentially mimic vat... but rarely the ally I 
   think. -> removed! adding Contagious Clasp instead

Sideboard usage:

  Against Mill, Sacrifice, Direct Damage Red:
  -1 Day of Judgement
  -2 Revoke Existence
  +3 Leyline of Sanctity

  Against Totem Armor; Eldrazi Monumnet; or Basilisk Collar:
  +3 Revoke Existence

  Against artifact heavy/dangerous deck:
  -1 Plain
  +1 Mountain
  +3 Tuktuk Scrapper
  -3 ???

  Against instructible artifact: 
  -1 or -2 Day of Judgement and +2 Revoke Existence
