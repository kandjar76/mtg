v2.0 -> v2.1:
-------------
-1 Okiba-Gang Shinobi
+1 Throat Slitter

v1.9 -> v2.0:
-------------
-2 Misty Rainforest
+2 Darkslick Shore

The shuffle of misty can be trouble some especialyl after laying down a bird or preordain.
Replacing it by Darkslick Shore seems like a good option :)

v1.8 -> v1.9:
-------------
-1 Sunken Ruins
+1 Distortion Strike

I almost always have too many lands in the deck :D
And I wanted to have 1 more distortion strike as it works sooo well w/ Ninjas!
