ravnica?

  | red/white   | radiance    | ravnica    | not that fun                             |
  | black/blue  | transmute   | ravnica    | could be fun but expensive               |
  | white/green | convoke     | ravnica    | nah                                      |
  | green/black | dredge      | ravnica    | kind of like that one                    |
  | red/green   | bloodthirst | guildpack  | nah...                                   |
  | red/blue    | replicate   | guildpack  | done with wee, not enough card to pursue |
  | white/black | haunting    | guildpack  | already done online                      |
  | red/black   | hellbent    | dissension | mmm... maybe...                          |
  | white/blue  | forecast    | dissension | nah.. missing good cards                 |
  | green/blue  | graft       | dissension | done                                     |


cross block idea:
 - wolf deck
 - archer deck!!
   -> turn creatures into flyer and shoot!!
   (skeet shooting)
 - draw to death!
   penalize the player from drawing and force him to draw many cards!

so basically:
  black/blue  - could be fun but expensive
  green/black - definitively interesting! (purchase in view?)
  red/black   - seems also interesting... will see!
  
  also: deck around the blue leyline (all permanent are legendary!!!)
