ravnica?

  | red/white   | radiance    | ravnica    | not that fun                             |
  | black/blue  | transmute   | ravnica    | could be fun but expensive               |
  | white/green | convoke     | ravnica    | nah                                      |
  | green/black | dredge      | ravnica    | kind of like that one                    |
  | red/green   | bloodthirst | guildpack  | nah...                                   |
  | red/blue    | replicate   | guildpack  | done with wee, not enough card to pursue |
  | white/black | haunting    | guildpack  | already done online                      |
  | red/black   | hellbent    | dissension | mmm... maybe...                          |
  | white/blue  | forecast    | dissension | nah.. missing good cards                 |
  | green/blue  | graft       | dissension | done                                     |

Maralen + Mindlock Orb -- fun dead lock
Flame Fusillade !!!! <- Investigation required!!!

- untap deck: using the mantle paradise, and the blue card from eldrazi to reduce the cost
- niz mizzet deck using the enchant to deal damage on draw (and the instant to move aura?)
- "level up" blue/other color deck
- 5 color deck!
- update the graft-control deck into a wizard-control deck?
  white/blue? 
  (protection, put counter from white)
  (blue: gain control / counter spell; and other fun stuff)


cross block idea:
 - wolf deck
 - archer deck!!
   -> turn creatures into flyer and shoot!!
   (skeet shooting)
 - draw to death!
   penalize the player from drawing and force him to draw many cards!

 - Update the sacrifice deck
 - Merfolk invasion deck! with the artifact which tap for mana and the guy which untap to exile to card of my lib.
   Couple with the guy which becomes tapped give you a draw!
   Cool combo to do...

so basically:
  black/blue  - could be fun but expensive
  green/black - definitively interesting! (purchase in view?)
  red/black   - seems also interesting... will see!
  
  also: deck around the blue leyline (all permanent are legendary!!!)
