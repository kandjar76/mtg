Post playtesting:
-----------------
I playtest Braids as well as an updated Yawgmoth.
And I have to day: I enjoy Yawgmoth more -- I feel that the deck has more answers, more options...
Granted: Attaching "Glithening Oil" to "Syr Konrad, the Grim" and almost kill everyone w/ infect was quite fun :-)
I'm still going to retired this deck as it does conflict too much with Yawgmoth.


Version v0.4:
-------------
I just realized that Bloodchief Ascension doesn't work very well with Braids.
Braids doesn't force the sacrificer AND the EOT triggers from Braids and Ascension do not work together.

Version v0.1:
-------------
The deck was fun to play with, but it does lack in many area:
- +1 or +2 tutors would help getting to the important cards (drainers)
- Need more target removal
- An additional mass removal wouldn't be a bad idea either.

The deck does overall feel unfocussed.
Need to determine what its goal is:
- Forcing other player to sacrifice? (Yes: more plaguecrafter effect, No: Prob best to remove it)
- Forcing other player to discard?
- Pure draining value? [<- Selected for v0.2+]

Does it conflict with Yawgmoth?
