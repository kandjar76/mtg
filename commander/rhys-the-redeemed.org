v1.2 -> v1.3:
-------------

Version 1.2:
------------
Another card, even though powerful leave me perplex in this deck: Skullclamp.

v1.1 -> v1.2:
-------------
-1 Sterling Grove
+1 Privileged Position

Version 1.1:
------------
Have yet to see the non-land card I replaced; but got Gavony twice already and it has been very helpful already!

I'm not too convinced with Sterling Grove.
I barely use it to search unless someone destroy it.
I'm gonna try: Privileged Position, so it will also protect, non ench perm.

v1.0 -> v1.1:
-------------
-1 Symbiotic Wurm
-1 Eldrazi Monument
-1 Stormhelm
+1 Tooth and Nail
+1 Defense of the Heart
+1 Mirror Entity
-1 Selesnya Sanctuary
+1 Gavony Township


v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-1 Idyllic Tutor
+1 Enlightment Tutor


Version 0.9:
------------
Idyllic Tutor cost too much most of the time.


v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-3 Forest
-2 Plains
+1 Selesnya Sanctuary
+1 Tranquil Thicket
+1 Secluded Steppe
+1 Selesnya Guildgate
+1 Sunpetal Grove


Version v0.8:
-------------
The addition of the destroy art/ench with saprolin generator has been a huge win!
I should consider other cards in that category...


v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-1 Advent of the Wurm
-1 Master of the Wild Hunt
-1 Honor of the Pure
-1 Ray of Revelation
-1 Recollect
+1 White Sun's Zenith
+1 Seed Sparks
+1 Return to Dusk
+1 Aura Mutilation
+1 Regrowth


v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Conqueror's Pledge
+1 Fresh Meat


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Sigil Captain
+1 Eldrazi Monument
-1 Twilight Drover
+1 Marial Coup
-1 Plains
+1 Opal Palace


v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Beastmaster Ascension
+1 Trostani's Summoner
-1 Seedborn Muse
+1 Creeping Renaissance


Version 0.4:
------------
Not sure about Seedborn Muse.


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Yavimaya Elder
-1 Growing Ranks
-1 Midning Haunting
-1 Wolfbriar Elemental
-1 Mentor of the Meek
-1 Hunting Pack
+1 Bestial Menace
+1 Spawnwrithe
+1 Symbiotic Wurm
+1 Hornet Queen
+1 Sigil Captain
+1 Spectral Procession


Version 0.3:
------------
The deck feels like it's finally getting there.

To Consider:
- Condemn
- Spear of Heliod
- Academy Rector
- Tooth and Nail
- Caged Sun
- Gauntlet of Power
- Also: anti flyer!


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Blade Splicer
-1 Thragtusk
-1 Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage
-1 Stoneforge Mystic
-1 Sundering Vitae
+1 Mirari's work
