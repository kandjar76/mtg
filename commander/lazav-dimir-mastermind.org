v1.3 -> v1.4:
-------------
-1 Diabolic Tutor
+1 Diabolic Revelation


Version 1.3:
------------
Considered Tamiyo however, as it has been pointed out, I would lack blockers to properly use her.
Much better! Mana wise.

Wouldn't Dread Return be better than Animate Dead?

The ramp is amazingly good!! I didn't expected that deck to need that much ramp.
But wow!!!
With that, I should be able to put the x3BB search spell in the deck!

I also think that:
- Chromatic Lantern could have a room in the deck
