Version 0.1:
------------
Initial draft had 29 basic lands.
I was too often color screwed.
-
I was facing a low CMC deck, and having "Disdainful Stroke" in hand 3 out of 4 games was super frustrating :)
After initial test:
-> The deck needs a lot more mana ramp to ensure having Arcades dropped on T3
