Version v0.5:

The deck feels like it's lacking ramp and draw....
I cannot always count on the commander to the cards.

Version v0.2:
-------------
Maybe a bit too many swamps.
More draws would be great... 
More token generator.

The lack of token maker is def a problem, also, if we have enough tokens, we'll draw more.
Big refactoring in perspective

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
- Aid the Fallen
+ Whip of Erebos
- Bontu the Glorified
+ Ashnod's Altar
- Geralf's Messenger

- Abyssal Persecutor
+ Kokusho, the Evening Star

Version 0.1:
------------
Deck was really fun to play with and turned out really good to keep the board clear, especially when "Dictatos of Erebos" or "Grave Pact" was in play.
Main issue was the life...
