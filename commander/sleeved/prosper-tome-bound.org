Version v0.2:

Won a game with "Revel In Riches" !!!! :-)
Seriously speaking, the game is super fun to drive.
Prosper is a massive value engine; giving you Treasure after Treasure while also giving u a new card to play each turn.
Even when the deck doesn't have much answer to the board and has very little chance to win... It's still very fun to pilot.

Xorn is a must run here... It's quite challenging to get more than 10/15 token, even though I'm casting tons of spells from exile.
Ragavan has been incredibly good in my last game; dashing is close to 10 times throughout the game.
Dream Devourer has been a bit underwhelming; even though the card is good; I often just want to cast the spell from my hand and not way a whole turn of the table to use them.
Finally, I would love a bit of graveyard recursion, Adadeem's Awakening is a card to consider.

Version 0.1:
------------
This is the "Planar Portal" Forgotten Realms Commander precon deck.
I played it twice as it, and it's a super fun deck to play.  The deck is suprisingly good out of the box.
