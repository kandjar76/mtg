Version v0.6:
-------------
More interaction, more aura to disable the opponent's threats; easier to give away.
Otherwise: really fun deck.
The MDFC Valakut Awakening is very strong and undervalued card.


v0.5 -> v0.6:
------------
+ Glacial Fortress
- Tranquil Cove
+ Arid Mesa
- Sejiri Refuge
+ Dualcaster Mage
- Niv-Mizzet, Parun
+ Austere Command
- Fulmigate
+ Thieving Skydiver
- Djinn of Infinite Deceits
+ Valakut Awakening // Valakut Stoneforge
- Illusionist's Gambit
+ Venser, the Sojourner
- Goblin Cadets
+ Chromatic Lantern
- Jeskai Banner
+ Island
- Mountain

Version v0.5:
-------------
Not sure the deck has enough lands... I'll need to test it out.
I'd like to add either more rocks or more lands.  Playtest is needed.
Especially since Maze of Ith is not a land in practice.

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
- Hall of Heliod's Generosity
+ Maze of Ith

v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
- Venser, the Sojourner
+ Cyclonic Rift
- Pramikon, Sky Rampart
+ Nine Lives
- Cast Out
+ Grasp of Fate
- Steel Golem
+ Academy Reactor
- Grid Monitor
+ Dance of the Manse
- Insurrection
+ Paradox Haze
- Blind Obedience
+ Solitary Confinement
- AETherspouts
+ Supreme Verdict
- Grand Arbiter Augustin IV
+ Teferi's Ageless Insight
- Kykar, Wind's Fury
+ The Locus God
- Wind-Scarred Crag
+ Rugged Prairie
- Highland Lake
+ Cascade Bluffs
- Terramorphic Expanse

+ Plains
- New Benalia
+ Marsh Flats
- Swiftwater Cliffs
+ Temple of Epiphany
- Meandering River
+ Temple of Enlightenment
- Azorius Guildgate
+ Mystic Gate


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
- Thought Lash
- Dominus of Fealty
+ Wild Research
+ Mad Ratter


Version v0.2:
-------------
Definitively a fun deck, love the political aspect of it.
However: I had Dominus in my hand the entire time and didn't play it; the fact that you have a wait a whole turn to possibly benefit from it is a big drawback.
I misunderstood Thought Lash, it's not a leave the battlefield effect, rather: if u don't pay, your exile your lib... (Great to combo with Thassa's Oracle)


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+ Land Tax
+ Glen Elendra Archmage
+ Venser, the Sojourner
+ Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker
+ Leyline of Anticipation
+ Perplexing Chimera
+ Brand
+ Snapcaster Mage
+ Blind Obedience
+ Idyllic Tutor
+ Narset's Reversal
+ Thought Lash
+ Nadir Kraken

- Assembly the Legion
- Torpor Orb
- Catch // Release
- Norn's Annex
- Wild Ricochet
- Electrodominance
- Puca's Mischief
- Windborn Muse
- Beguiler of Wills
- Goldnight Castigator
- Heat Stroke
- Rust Element
- Copy Enchantment


Toward v0.2:
------------
I realized that Kiki Jiki would be a good fit for the deck, removing Torpor Orb from it.
Kiki Jiki has many advantages:
- Instant win in conjonction with Zealous Conscript.
- But can also make copy of Djinn of Infinite Deceits, Agent of Treachery... to instant gain control of another creature, giving the token away will
prevent him from being sacrifice and will therefore benefit Zedruu's ability.


Version 0.1:
------------
Deck super fun, but needs a lot more answers.
Needs more instant play.
-> Counter spells
-> Leyline of Anticipation
-> Kill/Exile spells
-> More board wipes.
-> Possibly some graveyard recursion... 
Yeah I know, a lot of work...
