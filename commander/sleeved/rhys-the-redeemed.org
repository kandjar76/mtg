Toward v2.0:
------------
Being able to search for a non-creat removal is really important.
+1 Doubling Season
+1 Acidic Slime


v1.8 -> v1.9:
-------------
-1 Wilt-Lead Liege
+1 Triumph of the Hordes
-1 Conclave Tribunal
+1 Cast Out
-1 Lightning Greave
+1 Voice of Resurgence
-1 Fresh Meat
+1 Rest In Peace

Toward v1.9:
------------
More mass indestructible spells?
Also: Acidic Slime?
Considering removing:
- Wilt-Leaf Liege -- He doesn't create token, the +2/+2 is nice, but I have many other way to beef the creatures.... No need for this one.

Other card to add:
+1 Triumph of the Hordes
+1 Skullclamp ??
+1 Doubling Season -- Coz why not!


Version v1.8:
-------------
Played FFA 5 players game.
The indestructible spells were so good.
I think the deck could use some more.
Glare of Subdual is pretty neat! No complain's here; with a lot of token you can prevent any attacks.
Also: Divine Visitation is brutal.

I did miss Acidic Slime... 
The reason being: being able to search a creature to destroy an artifact or enchantment is really good.

I'm considering putting it back for v1.9...
I just don't know what to remove for it.


v1.7 -> v1.8:
-------------
-1 Green Sun's Zenith
+1 Chord of Calling
-1 Oblivion Ring
+1 Conclave Tribunal
-1 Moonsilver Spear
+1 Glare of Subdual
-1 Day of Judgement
+1 Beastmaster Ascension
-1 Spawnwrithe
+1 Divine Visitation
-1 Eternal Witness
+1 Join Shields
-1 Wrath of God
+1 Assure // Assemble
-1 Bestial Menace
+1 Camaraderie
-1 Elspeth, Knight-Errant
+1 Elspeth Tirel
-1 Acidic Slime
+1 Eldrazi Monument
-1 Trostani's Summoner
+1 Luminarch Ascension


v1.6 -> v1.7:
-------------
-1 Tolsimir Wolfblood
-1 Marshal's Anthem
+1 Huatli, Radiant Champion
+1 Nissa, Voice of Zendikar

Version 1.6:
------------ 
Marshal's Anthem should probably be replaced.

v1.5 -> v1.6:
-------------
-1 Spawning Grounds
+1 Fated Intervention

v1.4 -> v1.5:
-------------
-1 Primeval Bounty
+1 Spawning Grounds
-1 Forest
-2 Plains
+1 Saltcrusted Steppe
+1 Stirring Wildwood
+1 Graypelt Refuge

Version v1.4:
-------------
Actually, this deck doesn't cast THAT many creatures... So Primeval Bounty may not be the right choice here.
However, one thing I just realized: the color based need to be fixed!  I too often get color screwed with this deck.

v1.3 -> v1.4:
-------------
-1 Mimic Vat
+1 Primeval Bounty

Version 1.3:
------------
I'm not too convinced about Mimic Vat in this deck.
Aside from having something like: Acidic Slime under it... it's not too useful.x

v1.2 -> v1.3:
-------------
-1 Skullclamp
+1 Academy Reactor

Version 1.2:
------------
Another card, even though powerful leave me perplex in this deck: Skullclamp.

v1.1 -> v1.2:
-------------
-1 Sterling Grove
+1 Privileged Position

Version 1.1:
------------
Have yet to see the non-land card I replaced; but got Gavony twice already and it has been very helpful already!

I'm not too convinced with Sterling Grove.
I barely use it to search unless someone destroy it.
I'm gonna try: Privileged Position, so it will also protect, non ench perm.

v1.0 -> v1.1:
-------------
-1 Symbiotic Wurm
-1 Eldrazi Monument
-1 Stormhelm
+1 Tooth and Nail
+1 Defense of the Heart
+1 Mirror Entity
-1 Selesnya Sanctuary
+1 Gavony Township


v0.9 -> v1.0:
-------------
-1 Idyllic Tutor
+1 Enlightment Tutor


Version 0.9:
------------
Idyllic Tutor cost too much most of the time.


v0.8 -> v0.9:
-------------
-3 Forest
-2 Plains
+1 Selesnya Sanctuary
+1 Tranquil Thicket
+1 Secluded Steppe
+1 Selesnya Guildgate
+1 Sunpetal Grove


Version v0.8:
-------------
The addition of the destroy art/ench with saprolin generator has been a huge win!
I should consider other cards in that category...


v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-1 Advent of the Wurm
-1 Master of the Wild Hunt
-1 Honor of the Pure
-1 Ray of Revelation
-1 Recollect
+1 White Sun's Zenith
+1 Seed Sparks
+1 Return to Dusk
+1 Aura Mutilation
+1 Regrowth


v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Conqueror's Pledge
+1 Fresh Meat


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Sigil Captain
+1 Eldrazi Monument
-1 Twilight Drover
+1 Marial Coup
-1 Plains
+1 Opal Palace


v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Beastmaster Ascension
+1 Trostani's Summoner
-1 Seedborn Muse
+1 Creeping Renaissance


Version 0.4:
------------
Not sure about Seedborn Muse.


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Yavimaya Elder
-1 Growing Ranks
-1 Midning Haunting
-1 Wolfbriar Elemental
-1 Mentor of the Meek
-1 Hunting Pack
+1 Bestial Menace
+1 Spawnwrithe
+1 Symbiotic Wurm
+1 Hornet Queen
+1 Sigil Captain
+1 Spectral Procession


Version 0.3:
------------
The deck feels like it's finally getting there.

To Consider:
- Condemn
- Spear of Heliod
- Academy Rector
- Tooth and Nail
- Caged Sun
- Gauntlet of Power
- Also: anti flyer!


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Blade Splicer
-1 Thragtusk
-1 Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage
-1 Stoneforge Mystic
-1 Sundering Vitae
+1 Mirari's work
+1 Aura Shard
+1 Graterhoof Behemoth
+1 Sterling Grove
+1 Sylvan Library


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-1 Loxodon Hierarch
+1 Master of the Wild Hunt
-1 Rhys (oops)
+1 Seedborn Muse
-1 Mikaus, the Lunarch
+1 Avenger of Zendikar
-1 Luminarch Ascension
+1 Green Sun's Zenith
