+ Curfew
+ Whirlwind of Thought


Version v0.6:
-------------
The deck seems to be currently a bit inconsistent.
But it's super fun when it's working!
Bouncing the commander, casting it again and again from hand feels really good.
However, they deck may need more interaction with my opponents.

Having more synergy with casting spell would def benefits the deck: cards like Whirlwind of Thought is a must!

Couple of issue I faced:
- Which spells to cast? A spell to draw card? or a spell to interact.... 
  Although interacting spell are often the best options, it doesn't help advancing the game plan.
- Graveyard hate really need to be taking care ASAP.  This is one reason the deck needs more answers.


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
- Sea-Dasher Octopus
+ Valakut Awakening // Valakut Stoneforge


v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
- Raugrin Crystal
- Mana Geyser
+ High Tide
+ Kykar, Wind Fury
- Charmbreaker Devils
- Malignus
+ Memnite
+ Ornithopter
- Talrand, Sky Summoner
- River Kelpie
+ Hedron Crap
+ Palinchron
- Strionic Resonator
- Savor the Moment
- Stitch in Time
+ Silence
+ Brain Freeze
+ Council's Judgement
- Dream Fracture
+ Swan Song
- Insidious Will
+ Flusterstorm
- Leyline of Anticipation
+ Dockside Extortionist
- Sun Titan
+ Barrin, Master Wizard
- Dream Trawler
+ Saheeli, Sublime Artificier
- Geist of Saint Traft
+ Underworld Breach
- The Royal Scions
+ Thieving Skydiver
- Swiftfoot Boots
+ Gamble

Version v0.4:
-------------
Super fun, but I lacked ways to bounce my cmdr to my hand...
Sadly, didn't draw them.
I was able to recur "Cloud of Faeries" several times, it felt so powerful.

I didn't draw any counter spells until the end of the game and I notice a lack of interactive spells.
That said, I'm not sure I need a lot of them.  I really feel that adding more untap land creature would make a big diff.

v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
- Rapid Hybridization
+ Restore Balance

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
- Sword of Sinew and Steel
- Chandra, Awakened Inferno
- Aria of Fate
+ Price of Progress
+ The Royal Scions
+ Sun Titan

Note:
-----
I really like the idea of running Price of Progress which penalize every one for not playing basic lands.
That said, I should then run a bit more basic land in this deck.  
Especially if I also want to keep running: Planar Birth


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+ Sevinne's Reclamation
- High Tide
+ Thing in the Ice
- String of Disappearances
+ Wheel of Fate
- Island


Version v0.1:
-------------
The deck was fun, but would benefit from more graveyard interaction.
I need to had Sevinne's Reclamation as well as Sun Titan.
