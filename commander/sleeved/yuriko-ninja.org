Version 1.2:
------------
The deck needs better lands to go faster; also, needs ways to put stuff in the graveyard a bit.


Other considered addition:
--------------------------
+ Consign // Oblivion
+ Connive // Concoct
  - Not sure; the first part is really good... But the second half, not great in this current version of the deck.
+ Snuff Out
  - "Free" spell but only non black creats.
+ Rags // Riches
  - Wondering if -2/-2 is gonna be enough, especially sorcery speed...

Version 1.0:
------------
Fun deck, during the game I played, I was blocked by a counter heavy deck, and yet, I was able to do stuff. :-)
However, I think the deck is lacking in utility, like direct kill spell, or maybe one or two more board wipe.
As it, it's extremely weak to aggressive deck.
