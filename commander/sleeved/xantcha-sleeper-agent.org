+ Rakdos Carnarium

Version v0.3:
-------------
Super fun game!
Phyrexian Arena was definitively great to have in my opponing hand.
Soon followed on board by Painful Quandary which kept in check Bolas' Citadel


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
+ Phyrexian Arena
- Theater of Horrors
+ Bitterblossom
- Etali, Primal Storm
+ Endbringer
- Meteor Golem
+ Last One Standing

- Stitch Together
+ Esquisite Blood
- Praetor's Grasp
+ Dragonskull Summit
- Terrain Generator
+ Blood Crypt
- Molten Slagheap

Version v0.2:
-------------
The deck played fantastically well the second time.
My favorite move of the game were:
1- Electrodominance for 5 -> cast Neheb, the Eternal -> main phase 2: 5R -> Replicate: Shattering Spree
2- Goading creature when down to 1vs1 to force an attack while I was controlling Phyrexian Obliterator

The deck does have weakness against flying creature; considering maybe:
+ Bitterblossom  -> But I'm worry about the life loss...
+ Phyrexia Arena -> To boost the card draw

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
- Gamble
+ Demonic Tutor
- Field of Ruins
- Mountain
- Swamp
+ Tectonic Edge
+ Bojuka Bog
+ Myriad Landscape

Version 0.1:
------------
The deck would benefit from more card draw: Phyrexian Arena?
Also better lands: like Rogue Passage, scry land, man land?
