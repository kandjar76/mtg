Version v0.1:
-------------
Super fun to play; the deck draw and ramp a lot as expected.
I think a few more counterspell and maybe 1 more finisher would help the overall deck strategy.
Spell Contortion ended up being underwhelming...

Also, the deck can draw A LOT of cards; so having Reliquary Tower added to the deck is a MUST
Better color fixing land would be nice; turn out the deck has some heavy 1 color mana requirement (1U+2U or 2G+1G..)


Preamble to deck building:
-------------------------
I don't want to shy on the ramp, the deck will need to ramp a lot.
Kicker cost adds a lot to the normal CMC for average boost.

The deck does seem to want to go wide w/ +1 counters
Cards like: Doublin Season or Parallel Lives
