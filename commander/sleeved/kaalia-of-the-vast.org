Version v0.6:
-------------
The deck feels a lot better; however the mana color is awful! 
Need to be fixed!!!

Some of the Angel/Dragon/Demon needs to be replaced:
- Shattered Angel
- Rakdos, Lord of Riots
Some are questionable:
- Deathless Angel
- Lord of the Void
- Reaper from the Abyss
- Bladewing the Risen

Also, the deck would benefits from more art/ench removals - But it's hard to find a good candidate
