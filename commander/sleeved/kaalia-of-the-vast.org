Version v1.4:
-------------
Way too many big ass creatures; the deck is not consistent.
Probably need to drop to like 20 or so creatures
Solution; reducing the # of creatures, including some cheaper but strong creatures:
- Thundermaw Hellkite
- Lyra Dawnbringer (3WW for 5/5 with: Flying, first strike, lifelink -- Other angels you control get +1c and lifelink)
- Doom Whisperer (3BB for 6/6 with: flying, trample -- Pay 2 life: surveil 2
- Bloodgift Demon
More fast answer:
- Council's Judgement
Few more planeswalker?
- Liliana of the Veil?
- Ajani Vengeant
Other utilities:
- Rakdos Charm
- Experiment... stuff.. (can't play card from hand one)
- Liliana's Contract (if the deck has a bit more demon in it)

The deck feels a lot better; however the mana color is awful! 
Need to be fixed!!!

Some are questionable:
- Deathless Angel
- Lord of the Void
