+ Hushbringer
+ Shinewend (Morningtide)

Version 0.3:
------------
Played a couple of games; the deck is really fun, lots of draw, interaction. 
Seems pretty good as it; hard to see what I would need to replace for now.
Mangara and Keeper of the Accord turned out to be really really good!!!
Keeper of the Accord gave me free creatures to attack an opp in order to draw a card from Breena's ability.

Version 0.1:
------------
This is the "Silverquill Statement" Stryxhaven C21 precon deck.
I was able to play it twice, I had a lot of fun with it; especially the second game which had a lot of back and forth.
The deck feels a LOT more Voltron than Political.
Overall I did feel I lacked answered.... Lacked mass removal, target removal...
