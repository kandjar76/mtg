Version v0.5:
-------------
Just looking at the deck itself, I thought it needed more adjustment.
Since some of the adjustment required applies to 'newly' added cards'; well it's easier to just jump to v0.6.

v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
+ Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger
- Duplicant
+ Urza's Mine
+ Urza's Tower
+ Urza's Power Plant
- Phyrexia's Core
- Swiftwater Cliffs
- Izzet Guildgate
+ Mind Stone

+ Mystic Confluence
- Mass Manipulation
+ Frantic Search
- Thieving Skydiver
+ Mass Polymorph
- Phyrexian Metamorphx

Version v0.5:
-------------
The deck is seriously lacking draw spells, and needs more interactions.
Draw spells should be about 10.


v0.4 ->  v0.5:
--------------
- Magmaquake
+ Chandra's Ignition
- Forge of Heroes
+ Reliquary Tower
- Prismatic Lens
+ Thought Vessel


Version v0.4:
-------------
The deck need more finishing move.
It can drag in some cases....
Dual caster mage can go infinite with cards already in the deck:
 - Dualcaster Mage + Rites of Replication
 - Dualcaster Mage + Saheeli's Artistry
Brudiclad may be worth considering? For its haste component...

Another consideration: Chandra's Ignition, a way to clear the board or close the game.
 - Chandra's Ignition + Blightsteel Colossus



Also, as expected: Niv-Mizzet is too hard to cast....
Last two games, I had it in my hand and didn't cast (or wasn't able to) due to his color demanding mana cost.
Maybe another Niv-Mizzet would be better?



v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
+ Skyclave Relic
- Darksteel Ingot
+ Akroma's Memorial
- God-Pharaoh's Statue
+ Inspiring Statuary
- Magnifying Glass
+ Ugin, the Spirit Dragon
- Inkwell Leviathan
+ Wayfarer's Bauble
- Traveler's Amulet
+ Talisman of Creativity
- Izzet Locket
+ Curse of the Swine
- Icy Blast
+ Mirage Mirror

+ Riverglide Pathway // Lavaglide Pathway
- Highland Lake
+ Skullclamp

+ Etali, Primal Storm
- Platinum Angel
+ Thieving Skydiver
- Spellskite
+ Mana Geyser
- Treasure Nabber
+ Sakashima's Will
- Silent Arbiter
+ Consecrated Sphinx
- Domineering Will


Version 0.3:
------------
Played the deck at a commander event, it was a lot of fun, some cards shined:
  [Saheeli's Artistry / Saheeli Rai]  -> Myr Battlesphere

The deck would benefits from more draw engine.
Also, it's weak against flying creature which makes it hard to defend Saheeli.


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
- Thirst for Knowledge
- Clever Impersonator
+ Saheeli, Sublime Artificer
+ God-Pharaoh's Statue

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
- Mind Spring
+ Saheeli Rai
- Treasure Mage
+ Whir of Invention
- Grand Architect
+ Pathrazer of Ulamog
- Trinket Mage
+ Mass Manipulation

Version 0.1:
------------
Deck was really fun, I'm wondering if I should put more Eldrazi in it ;D
Haste is really important, to allow some serious out of nowhere pressure.
Maybe more Eldrazi???
