v1.2 -> v1.3: (in progress)
-------------
+ Zendikar Resurgent
- Guardian Project
+ Land upgrade?
+ More search?
- ???

Version v1.2:
-------------
Super fun deck still, love the morph ability.

Strionic Resonator is quite strong in this deck
Also Kheru Spellsnatcher and Chromeshell Crab were super good.
I used "Kheru Spellsnatcher" to take "Zendikar Resurgent" which was insanely good!!

Having an extra search (Demonic Tutor or Beseech the Queen) would be good.
However what needs to go in the deck is: "Zendikar Resurgent" once I had it on my side of the field, its effect was too good.

I'm not sure if I like: "Trail of Mystery"; that said, it was mostly coz I couldn't drop more than one land a turn...
It's still good to thin the deck I think.

Additional information:
-----------------------
Torpor Orb is a TERRIBLE CARD for this deck.
Although it's true that morph ability is not an ETB; the commander itself has ETB triggers when a face down creature enters!
