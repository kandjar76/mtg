This is the "Silverquill Statement" Stryxhaven C21 precon deck.
I was able to play it twice, I had a lot of fun with it; especially the second game which had a lot of back and forth.
The deck feels a LOT more Voltron than Political.
Overall I did feel I lacked answered.... Lacked mass removal, target removal...
