Version v0.1:
-------------
The deck was fun to play with, but it does lack in many area:
- +1 or +2 tutors would help getting to the important cards (drainers)
- Need more target removal
- An additional mass removal wouldn't be a bad idea either.

The deck does overall feel unfocussed. 
Need to determine what its goal is:
- Forcing other player to sacrifice? (Yes: more plaguecrafter effect, No: Prob best to remove it)
- Forcing other player to discard?
- Pure draining value?

Does it conflict with Yawgmoth?
