v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
+1 Green Sun's Zenith
+1 Dryad Arbor (land/elf)
-1 Forest
-1 ???

New cards to really consider:
----------------------------
Vampiric Rites
Mazirek, Kraul Death Priest
Rakshasa Gravecaller
Sword of the Animist
Sidisi, Undead Vizier
Meren of the Clan Nel Toth
Dictate of Erebos
Grasp of Fate
Disciple of Bolas


Version 0.3:
------------
Unfortunately, the deck as it has a inf loop system
With: Nim Deathmantle + Ashnod's Altar + Grave Titan...
 and the commander = inf board swipe , inf life, in creatures....


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
+1 Black Sun's Zenith
+1 Diabolic Tutor
+1 Necrogenesis
+1 Putrefy
+1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth
-1 Grave-Shell Scarab
-1 Swamp
-1 Momentous Fall
-1 Perilous Forays
-1 Mitotic Slime

Version 0.2:
------------
Need more search, more wrath (Black Sun Zenith)
Also: need early play... or more ramp; it would seem that the deck doesn't really have anything useful to do early on.


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+1 Gaze of Granite
-1 Shriekmaw

Version 0.1:
------------
OK... I do need wrath effect in this deck.
