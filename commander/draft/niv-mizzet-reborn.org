Version v0.2:
-------------
The commander is such a value engine....
I was able to drop: General Ferrous Rokiric very early on, wow! 
This card is monstrous in this deck!!!  And hard to remove as a lot of removal spells are mono-color.
Mana color wise, the dual lands helped a lot; I need more play testing to see if I should add more to the deck or not.
Another card which turned out to be really good: Lavinia of the Tenth; it can to help finishing up an opponent preventing him from blocking with his tokens.

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
- Steam Augury
+ Cerebral Vortex
- Vela the Night-Clad
+ Soul Manipulation
- Growth Spiral
- Coiling Oracle
+ Voidslime
+ Koma, Cosmos Serpent
- Battle of Frost and Fire
+ Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius
- Ethereal Valkyrie
+ Supreme Verdict
- Knight of the Reliquary
+ Mirari's Wake

- Manamorphose (Jegantha, the Wellspring [Companion] will take its place)
- Forest
- Forest
+ Temple Garden
+ Stomping Ground
+ Hallowed Fountain


Version v0.1:
-------------
The land base need to be fixed, Far Seek and Ranger Path aren't great right now
Jegantha, the Wellspring was useless.... I didnt even try to get it in my hand, 3 + 5 to get it out is too much mana :(
Moving to v0.2: I'm removing the companion, it may go in the 99.
