+ Sun Titan
+ The Royal Scions


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+ Sevinne's Reclamation
- High Tide
+ Thing in the Ice
- String of Disappearances
+ Wheel of Fate
- Island


Version v0.1:
-------------
The deck was fun, but would benefit from more graveyard interaction.
I need to had Sevinne's Reclamation as well as Sun Titan.
