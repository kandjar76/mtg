Consideration for v0.3:
-----------------------
+ Sun Titan
+ Archaeomancer
+ Peregrine Drake
- Intangible Virtue
- Drogskull Captain
+ More draw spells!!!
+ Samurai of the Pale Curtain
+ Altar of Dementia
+ Pergrine Drake


Version v0.2:
-------------
I played a few games against mid-level decks.
Not drawing spells is really bad.... When I was able to get Skullclamp through "Trinket Mage", the deck played a lot better.
Lack of draw causes the deck to crawl.  I should bumb the number of draw spell in the deck.

The deck had a few nonbo with "Skullclamp": if I have an Anthem effect, then "Skullclamp" is a lot less effective... Also: "Rest In Peace" and "Skullclamp" do not work together.
I think I need to decide if I want to (1) win by combat or (2) draw my deck to get my wincon.
Since I like the idea of finding a wincon more appealing, I need to remove the Anthems.
Regarding "Rest In Peace" and "Skullclamp"; considering how good each card can be individually, it's worth keeping both in the deck.
Considering that the two combo pieces are less than 3 mana; I'm going to put Sun Titan back in the deck.

I drew and played "Keeper of the Accord"; that card was amazing... Def worth running in the deck.
I wish I had Archaeomancer in those games

Version 0.1:
------------
This is the "Phantom Premonition" Kaldheim precon deck.
I played against other low power deck, the deck was quite fun to play but I felt it lack a bit
of synergy with the commander... It's possible that my draws were not great, yet I had a lot of fun playing it.
