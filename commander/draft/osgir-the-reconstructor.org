Version v0.2:
-------------

Played a game against 2 group hugs decks... so I'll have to see if the deck has enough draw spells.
I do still want to add the Baubles; however, the deck was so fun to drive.
I made used of Key to the City to eliminate one of my opponent with commander damage.

Archaemancer's Map + artifact lands is a fantastic combo.  Furthermore when you run out of lands, you can sac the map and bring it back one more time with Osgir.
Ugin's Nexus is just fantastic, reviving it with Osgir is great.   I was able to do it again w/ Mirage Mirror.
Finally, Hellkite Tyrant synergizes very well with the deck as you tend to have a lot of artifacts.

-

Second game was also super fun, the deck can really draw a lot; I wonder if I should put Reliquary Tower in it.
As: I could get an overwhelming amount of card in hand, at the same time, being able to discard artifacts is also a positive aspect for the deck.
However, cards I should really consider cards which would give more ways for my commander to untap, or maybe trigger his ability...
Hellkyte Tyrant + Ugin's Nexus were also the win-con for the game

I'm wondering if I should add one or more mass removal; the deck doesn't run a lot of creature and can be overwhelmed.

-

Third game, with Annointed Procession in play, and two copies of Mirrage Mirror, I was able to make 16 Mana Vault, to then cast: Crackle with Power with X = 16 :-)

--

Overall, I need more testing, I love the deck.  Not sure if cards like Sun Titan belongs in it for example.

Version v0.1:
------------
This is the "Lorehold Legacies" Stryxhaven C21 precon deck.
The deck was quite fun to play, lacked ways to fill up the graveyard.
The deck was also lacking from low CMC artifacts and low CMC ramp cards.
