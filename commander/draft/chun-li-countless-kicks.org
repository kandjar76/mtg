About Initial Draft:
--------------------
Oopsie... I hadn't realize ("reading the card explains the card") that Chun-Li ability required you to PAY the mana cost of the spells with 'kick counters'...
The deck will need a semi-major rethinking before play-testing it.

Also: I had at first in the deck Turnabout and High Tide; both cards have very little utility since I have to pay the mana of all the "kicked" spells before they can resolve.
