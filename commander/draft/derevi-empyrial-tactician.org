Version 0.8:
------------
There are still some card, I m not convinced they should be in the deck.
Amongst them:
- Birthing Pod
- Akroma's Memorial: It's good.. but doesn't really belong in this deck.
- Staff of Nim: I dont actually have a lot of creatures... to benefit from it.


v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-1 Blasting Station
-1 Beck // Call
+1 Bant Charm
+1 Wargate

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Order of Whiteclay
+1 Sun Titan

Version 0.6:
------------
There are still cards, I'm not sure if they fit the deck... At the same time: I want to play with them :)
- Order of Whiteclay
- Blasting Station
- Beck // Call


v0.5 -> v0.6;
-------------
-1 Priviledge Position
+1 Skullclamp
-1 AEtherling
+1 Windreader Sphinx
-1 Experiment Kraj
-1 Murkfiend Liege
+1 Vanish into Memory
+1 Auriok Windwalker
-1 Kodoma's Reach
+1 Sylvan Scrying

Version v0.5:
-------------
Does overall feels better.
A bit slow to take off...
No big wow factor.  Not yet convinced.

I need more benefits from sacrificing creatures.
Cards to add:
+++ Skullclamp 
+   Deathrender

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Mikaeus, the Lunarch
+1 Eternal Witness


Version 0.4:
------------
Had Mikaeus in hand the whole time.  Even with tons of mana open... I didn't use it...
Or even saw myself using it.
Mikaeus would be better in a token based deck.
Also: I need more way to get thing back from my graveyard.


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Tawnos' Coffin
-1 Sun Titan
-1 Winged Coatl
-1 Strinic Resonator

+1 Blasting Station
+1 Helm of Possession
+1 Phyrexian Vault
+1 Momentous Fall
+1 Birthing Pod
+1 Phyrexian Metamorph
+1 Solemn Simulacrum
+1 Green Sun's Zenith


Versoin 0.3:
------------
I need to change the deck a bit.
  The commander often gets targetted by Oblation and similar spells.

What needs to go in:
- Search spells (x2 or x3)
- Sac outlets (x5 if possible)

Mmmm... Strionic Resonator?
Oops!  If anything it should go in the Roon's deck!


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Stoonybrook Schoolmaster
-1 Sigil Tracker
-1 Back to Nature
-1 Nevinyrral's Disk
+1 Strionic Resonator
+1 Rewind
+1 Mikaeus, the Lunarch
+1 Priviledge Position


Version 0.2:
------------
Seaside is definitively nice.
Allowing me to recur derevi over in order to easily draw cards.
The deck plays a lot like a draw-go type.

I feel that I don't have enough good 'tap' creatures.

Overall:
- Swords and other equipment are really fun.  Quite strong actually.
  Best two are definitively: Diviner's Want and Argentum Armor.
- Feel that there's not enough creature with tab ability.  I often use Derevi to untap land or mana.
- Maybe 2 or 3 more counterspell - The deck is very much draw go style.
- Double strike and unblockable would help a lot.
  And Swiftboots are better than Lightning Greaves
  Maybe worth consider: Asceticism or even better: Priviledged Position.
  The downside: it's an enchantment, and the only one.

Not convinced by:
- Nevinyrral's Disk: I often have too many artifact and I dont want to blow them up.
- Stonybrook Schoolmaster: Yeah he's nice and so... But doesn't really do much.  Handy early on against sac decks.
- Sigil Tracker: Not that many spell I want to copy...  So most of the time, it's just a dummy 2/2 for 1UU
- Scavenging Ooze: Hasn't done much yet.  That say: the deck needs at least 1 graveyard hater!
- Back To Nature: there are artifact you don't want to remove (some O-Ring style which captured an opp permanent you don't want to see again)


v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-1 Opal Palace
+1 Seaside Heaven


Version v0.1:
-------------
Opal Palace is quite useless... As I barely ever cast Derevi.
