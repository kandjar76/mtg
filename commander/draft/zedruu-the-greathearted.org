Toward v0.2:
------------
I realized that Kiki Jiki would be a good fit for the deck, removing Torpor Orb from it.
Kiki Jiki has many advantages:
- Instant win in conjonction with Zealous Conscript.
- But can also make copy of Djinn of Infinite Deceits, Agent of Treachery... to instant gain control of another creature, giving the token away will
prevent him from being sacrifice and will therefore benefit Zedruu's ability.


Version 0.1:
------------
Deck super fun, but needs a lot more answers.
Needs more instant play.
-> Counter spells
-> Leyline of Anticipation
-> Kill/Exile spells
-> More board wipes.
-> Possibly some graveyard recursion... 
Yeah I know, a lot of work...
