A decision has been made: I'm gonna sleeve this deck.
That said, they are couple of cards which need a spot in it:
- Blue Sun's Zenith
- Green Sun's Zenith
The deck desesperately needs draws!

Another card to consider:
- Strionic Resonator


0
v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-1 Sunblast Angel
-1 AEthersnipe
+1 Angel of Serenity
+1 Reveillark

-1 Tel-Jilad Justice
+1 Archaeomancer
-1 Dissipate
+1 Mindbreak Trap


Version 0.1:
------------
Fun deck.
However, I feel the deck needs more draws...
Or potentially search... and graveyard recursion :)

Not too exited about Sunblast Angel... Yes another attempt which failed...
AEthersnipe... hasn't really be needed.  I almost always wanted a mass effect -- it'a also non-land.

Also, I need more ways to return instance from the graveyard to the hand.
More than just a fantastic witness...
