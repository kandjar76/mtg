v2.3 -> v2.4:
-------------
-1 Fabricate
+1 Increasing Ambition

Version v2.3:
-------------
There was one more change I wanted to try, but decided to postpone it:
+1 Increasing Ambition
-1 ???? [Enigma Sphinx? / Thirst for Knowledge? / Tower of Fortunes?]

Post testing: 
I'm really liking the deck, and in a fun way, learning how to play with it.
Some of the recent addition has proven very useful, such as: triskalion, lightning greaves...

Fabricate is just ok... I'm always wondering what to get with it.
Changing it for Increasing Ambition.

Myr Retriever is also a card I'd like to try...
Not sure what to remove yet.

v2.2 -> v2.3:
-------------
+1 Talisman of Progress
+1 Talisman of Dominance
-1 Azorius Cluestone
-1 Dimir Cluestone
+1 Bident of Thassa
-1 Ichor Wellspring
+1 Counterspell
-1 Perplex
+1 Dispeller Capsule
-1 Glaring Spotlight
+1 Lightning Greaves
-1 Swiftfoot Boots 

Version 2.2:
------------
The deck is finally becoming fun.
It has some great interaction.

Things to consider:
- One or two search spells.
- One or two more counter spells
- Maybe adding following lands: Reliquary Tower and Strip Mine (then should we consider adding: Crucible of Worlds
- Wondering if Lightning Greaves would not be better Swiftfoot Boots [The only targetting ability I can think of is Sydri's one] 
- Karmic Justice is definitively nice
- Bident of Thassa was also really good.


v2.1 -> v2.2:
-------------
-1 Moonglove Extract
-1 Thopter Foundry
+1 Triskellion
+1 Tower of Fortunes


v2.0 -> v2.1:
-------------
-1 Praetor's Gasp
-1 Relic of Progenitus
-1 Sharding Sphinx
+1 Vedalken Orrery
+1 Enigma Sphinx
+1 Diabolic Revelation

Version 2.0:
------------
Brand new version of this deck...
Trying to make is less boring to play with or against!

Initial playtest are promising.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.7 -> v0.8:
-------------
-1 Lin-Dul Vault
-1 Sphinx of Revelation
-1 Diabolic Revelation
+1 Increasing Ambition
+1 Phyrexian Arena
+1 Island

v0.6 -> v0.7:
-------------
-1 Consume the Meek
-1 Evil Twin
-1 Bullwhip
-1 Rod of Ruin
-1 Mana Vault
-1 Roar of the Revelation
+1 Dromar's Charm
+1 Thoughtcast
+1 Sharding Sphinx
+1 Batterskull
+1 Spinal Embrace
+1 Master of Etherium


Version 0.6:
------------
To be considered: Pristine Talisman
Also, I think the deck is clearly lacking creatures!!!
Adding about 9 creature would be nice!


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Counterspell
-1 Stoic Rebuttal
+1 Spell Crumble
+1 Esper Charm

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Planar Portal
-1 Sphinx Summoner
-1 Spine of Ish Sah
+1 Dispeller's Capsule
+1 Counterspell
+1 Stoic Rebuttal


Version 0.4:
------------
Massive art destruction really hurts.
I feel like: 
. I should had some more counterspell
. Maybe Crucible of Worlds

I'd like to add:
+ 2 cheap counter spells (CMC wise)
+ Dispeller's Capsule
+ Nevinyrral's Disk

Removing potentially:
- Spine of Ish Sah
- Sphinx Summoner
- Planar Portal


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Mikaeus, the Unhallowed
-1 Triskallion
+1 Karmic Justice
+1 Vedalken Orrerey


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Tainted Isle
-1 Tainted Field
+1 Orzhov Guildgate
+1 Dimir Guildgate


Version v0.2:
-------------
The deck is fun!
Two points:
- tainted lands -> not so much, w/ only 6 swamp, the odds aren't in my favor :)
- I should consider running 2 to 3 more counter spells.

Also: Mikaeus + Triskallion = GGs.
Not fun. That said; i dont have to use it :)
  [-1 Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]
  [+1 Contagion Engine       ]

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-1 Open the Vaults
+1 Roar of the Reclamation
+1 Return to Dust
-1 Mortify
-1 Thoughtcast
+1 Well of Lost Dream
-1 Thirst for Knowledge
+1 Scourglass
-1 Copy Artifact
+1 Sphinx's Revelation


Version 0.1:
------------
I'm a bit concerned of the lack of counter spells in this version...
We'll see.

mmm... Pything Needle HURTS!!! :)
