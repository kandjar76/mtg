Version 0.6:
------------
To be considered: Pristine Talisman
Also, I think the deck is clearly lacking creatures!!!
Adding about 9 creature would be nice!


v0.5 -> v0.6:
-------------
-1 Counterspell
-1 Stoic Rebuttal
+1 Spell Crumble
+1 Esper Charm

v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Planar Portal
-1 Sphinx Summoner
-1 Spine of Ish Sah
+1 Dispeller's Capsule
+1 Counterspell
+1 Stoic Rebuttal


Version 0.4:
------------
Massive art destruction really hurts.
I feel like: 
. I should had some more counterspell
. Maybe Crucible of Worlds

I'd like to add:
+ 2 cheap counter spells (CMC wise)
+ Dispeller's Capsule
+ Nevinyrral's Disk

Removing potentially:
- Spine of Ish Sah
- Sphinx Summoner
- Planar Portal


v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-1 Mikaeus, the Unhallowed
-1 Triskallion
+1 Karmic Justice
+1 Vedalken Orrerey


v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-1 Tainted Isle
-1 Tainted Field
+1 Orzhov Guildgate
+1 Dimir Guildgate


Version v0.2:
-------------
The deck is fun!
Two points:
- tainted lands -> not so much, w/ only 6 swamp, the odds aren't in my favor :)
- I should consider running 2 to 3 more counter spells.

Also: Mikaeus + Triskallion = GGs.
Not fun. That said; i dont have to use it :)
  [-1 Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]
  [+1 Contagion Engine       ]

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
-1 Open the Vaults
+1 Roar of the Reclamation
+1 Return to Dust
-1 Mortify
-1 Thoughtcast
+1 Well of Lost Dream
-1 Thirst of Knowledge
+1 Scourglass
-1 Copy Artifact
+1 Sphinx's Revelation


Version 0.1:
------------
I'm a bit concerned of the lack of counter spells in this version...
We'll see.

mmm... Pything Needle HURTS!!! :)
