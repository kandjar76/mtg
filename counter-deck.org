Weaknesses: flying! - Idea: go through b4 getting damage by them :P
   -- need a way to destroy ench or art.

To keep in mind:
  Forgotten Ancient
  Strength of the Tajuru (GGx + multikicker 1 -> put X +1 counter on Y creats)
  Brawn (as long as in the graveyard, creats u control have trample)
  Invert the sky
  Primal Rage (creats u control have trample!!!)

To Modify:
  Add ways to destroy ench and art! 
  Raking Canopy - sideboard?
