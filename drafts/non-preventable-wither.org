Idea:
 - using the enchantment which makes damage non-preventable, 
     everlasting torment (2{br})
       -> player can't gain life, damage can't be prevented, all damage dealt as wither damage
 - using the move counter combo
     
     
 - using demigod of revenge?
      {br} x 5
      5/4 fly, haste, when comes into playl return all creat card from graveyard named dem... to play
 - how about dusk urchins
      2B
      a 4/3 creatures, which has: when attacks or block, put a -1c on it,
      when put to graveyard draw cards eq to the number of counters on it
 - to prevent creature w/ -1c to attack:
      Kulrath Knight  3{rb}{rb} 
      3/3 fly wither - Creats ur opp control w/ -1c can't attack or bock
 - to make sure ur creat gets bigger:
      
  

Lovely cards:
 Nettlevine Blight -- funny one to play w/
 Polluted Bonds -- anti landfall!
