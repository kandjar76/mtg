Hey guys,

One thing I think everybody loves are cantrip spells...
So why not building a 'casual' deck around this idea :)

After some research, it would seems that UG should be the main colors of the deck with potentially splashing white.

I starting listing what I feel could be a good starting point for htis deck


As a 2 CMC creature spells we have: 
* [c]Wall of Blossom[/c]   (Really good to slow down aggro decks)
* [c]Elvish Visionary[/c]
* [c]Coiling Oracle[/c] (indirect draw)

Going to 3 CMC creature spells:
* [c]Cavern Cayatid[/c]  One of the best wall; can kill creature and draw...
* [c]Wistful Selfie[/c]
* [c]Sea Gate Oracle[/c] (another indirect draw)
* [c]Shardless Agent[/c] (not technically a draw... But if u hit a 2 CMC creatures, you will draw...)

Well and technically, there's also:
* [c]Vendillion Clique[/c] with which if you target yourself let you draw a card after sinking another one... BUT: I'm don't feel dropping $200 for it... :)

Then for the 4 CMC+ creature spells:
* [c]Mulldrifter[/c] -- Draw two cards w/ potentially a 2/2 flyer for late game; me liking it
* [c]Pelakka Wurm[/c] - A delay draw... and a life boost on a stick.
* [c]Regal Force[/c] -- At the very least you'll draw one card..
* [c]Prime Speaker Zegana[/c] -- To fully benefit from her, you need big creatures
* [c]Jungle Barrier[/c] -- Another wall... but more expensive than Ball of Blossom and Cavern Cayatid
* [c]Masked Admirers[/c] -- Hard to get rid of type of creatures... 
* [c]Solemn Simulacrum[/c] -- Another delayed draw...


And to close the creature list, I think one specific creature deserve a place in this list, even if it doesn't draw anything:
* Lorescales Coatl -- I don't think there is anything else which can benefits from draws better than this one.


That give already a nice decent set of creatures to use...



Now let's have a look at some non creatures spells which also have draw benetifs,
and that list can be really really long :) So I'm just going to select a few here...

* Explore -- Mana ramp w/ draw... It's almost 'take an extra turn' type of card!
* Remand -- How about delaying whatever your opponent does?
* Snakeform -- I love watching the fact of my opponent every time they attack and I turn their creature into useless 1/1 :)
* Spreading Seas -- If you face a lot of annoying lands :) -- but works better in Venser based deck.
* Into the roil -- Always nice to bounce stuff which turn into a mid game cantrip
* Ground Seal -- More of a sideboard cards...
* Jace Beleren -- Well JTMS is clearly better but also 10x more expensive :)
* Dream fracture
...
