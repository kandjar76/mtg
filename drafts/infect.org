Alright: infect colors: Main B
secondary?
 - G -> Putrefax + mana acceleration (lotus cobra???)
 - R -> Kiln Fiend (gets +3/0 for each instant/sorc -> tainted strike)
 - U -> unblockable?
   Distortion Strike (U -> tgt creat gets +1/0 and unblockable + rebound) 
   also: black/blue land turning into 3/2 unblockable

Let's try fully black fisrt!
