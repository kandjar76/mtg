v0.4 -> v0.5:
-------------
-1 Forest
-1 Plains
-1 Mountain
+3 Jungle Shrine

Version v0.4:
-------------
Momentous Fall is just a great card; especially when walls have such high power.

v0.3 -> v0.4:
-------------
-3 Fling
+3 Momentous Fall
-1 Cinder Wall
-1 Wall of Razor
+2 Rage Nimbus
-4 Tinder Wall
+4 Lightning Bolt
-2 Overgrown Battlement
-2 Vent Sentinel
+4 Farseek
-3 Abundant Growth
+1 Manor Gargoyle
+1 Stomping Ground
+1 Sacred Foundry
-1 Forest
-1 Mountain
+2 Kessig Wolf Run

Version 0.3:
------------
After an exhaustive playtest against Connor's deck, we came to the conclusion that the deck
although thematic, was not refined at all and was trying to do two things at once... 
(damage through attack and benefit from large # of defenders)

v0.2 -> v0.3:
-------------
-3 Farseek
+3 Abundant Growth
-2 Forest
+2 Sunpetal Grove
-2 Mountain
+2 Clifftop Retreat

Version v0.2:
-------------
Overall much better; manamorphose is just a great fun card to have.
That said; more draws and currently more color fixing.

v0.1 -> v0.2:
-------------
+2 Tinder Wall
+4 Manamorphose
+2 Forest
-2 Wall of Blossoms
-2 Rage Nimbus
-2 Vent Sentinel
-1 Wakestone Gargoyle
-1 Overgrown Battlement

Version 0.1:
------------
Fun idea; but two issue:
- lack of draws
- lack of mana
